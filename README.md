# Introduction

Technology is the new religion and we are its followers. We willingly build algorithms that conform, and design interfaces that offer little resistance. Instead of _surfing the web_, we swipe aimlessly. **Success!** We have turned the Internet into [Pleasantville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9EHRObUQqY), and we are its numb inhabitants, slaves to the screen.

But has technology brought us closer or further apart? Does an email cost the environment less than a letter? Can "Dark Mode" be seen as innovation? Let's do better. **This is our environment**. We are not just the inhabitants, we are also the architects, the creatives, the entrepreneurs and the builders!

During four weeks, students at Hyper Island will explore [creative coding](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/short-courses/stories/how-to-start-creative-coding) and bridge the gap between screen and present. The project will be split into two separate two-week assignments: [Generative Design of Data](brief/generative-design-of-data.md) and [Hello New World](brief/hello-new-world.md). Assignments are done individually, but within [Learning Groups](./#learning-groups) where it is possible to team up \(but not mandatory\).

{% hint style="warning" %}
This project follows the [p5.js code of conduct](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)!
{% endhint %}

_The work from the first challenge can be continued and developed under the umbrella of the second challenge._

## Schedule

### Workshops

Workshops will follow a simple **Learn ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test** structure with theory and practice in rapid succession. This means that students are expected to code during workshops, and learning assignments will be closely connected to the theory. 

There will be bonus workshops during the project which students can join by the end of the day.

‚Üí [Read about the workshops!](info/workshops.md)

### Talks

Start of your day with an interesting talk! Each week will have at least 1 speaker highlighting a topic within code and design.

### Code Review

Debugging is difficult, and sometimes it's hard to even understand what to look for. Tempting as it may be, it is wise to practice üêõ elimination while also becoming more **self-reliant**. Here's the order I suggest you follow when challenged:

1. Ask yourself
2. Ask yourself again \(and really think about it\)
3. Ask a friend directly
4. Ask in Slack
5. Ask the Internet
6. Join code review and ask Jonas

"But I want to get the answer now!"

You'd be surprised how fast people at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) responds \(sometimes minutes\), and you should be able to park a problem for a while and not let it stop your progress. **Get some fresh air!**

There are also other reasons for asking publicly:

1. Those with similar problems may get help from the comments.
2. You may get a wide range of answers that solve problems further down the line.
3. You improve your ability to analyse a problem and write a concise question.

With that said, there will be Code Review each week where we try to find solutions together, without any pressure. Just join in and we take it as it comes.

Also, take your time and watch [Let's talk about your creative IQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdsAcNKD9i0&list=PLfJZEI22FEjSXWzbxRfaueY71jiPuFH4V&index=96) with Teo H√§r√©n. It's a small reminder on how our brain tends to look for the easy way out.

### Creative Review & Presentation

Each week there will be a moment to either have review with the Industry Leader, a moment to check on progress and evaluate next steps, or a presentation with the class, sharing the work done so far.

### Learning groups

Will be announced as the project start. Consider filling out the [Remote Work Canvas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h6NfQ07xdu9tq-129YNphhQGCKz371HJTLb4vWCcifY/edit#slide=id.g816f5ffe36_1_213).

Things to ask yourselves as you get going:

* How do I feel about this Module? 
* What would I like to learn/get out from it? 
* How would I like to challenge myself? 
* What support would I like to get from you? 
* What support would I like to give to you? 
* How would I like us to work together? 
* Talk about practicalities: How/when will you connect? \(checkins-outs, etc\) 
* Have a Learning Group Leader? \(if so, what do you need from that role?\)

### Class representatives

Besides being the unsung heroes, the representatives assist in the structure and facilitation of the project.

</table>## On a personal note‚Ä¶

I truly believe code can bring huge positive impact to ourselves, to our communities, to the world. At the same time, I simply enjoy the "act of coding" no matter what it is. I like solving problems. I love riddles. I like movies that offer suspense and twists.

I also believe in community and teams, but at the same time, I am a very much a lone ranger, a soloist. I like other peoples company, but I prefer to be by myself. Now, I know that it's not always the most beneficial to my mental state, and it's definitely not always accelerating my learning, but it's also part of who I am.

This project is designed for you, and I will be here as rock-solid support whenever needed. I am extremely present when I teach, and due to the circumstances, I will try to be so even more - even though remotely. I expect that you will communicate your needs, give this your best, and you can expect that I will do the same.
