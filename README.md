# Introduction

Technology is the new religion. We willingly build algorithms that enslave us, and interfaces that offer little resistance. Instead of _surfing the web_, we swipe aimlessly. **Success!** We have turned the Internet into [Pleasantville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9EHRObUQqY), and we are its numb inhabitants.

But has technology brought us closer? Does an email cost less than a letter? Can "Dark Mode" be seen as innovation? We can do better. **This is our environment**. And here, we are not just the inhabitants, we are also the architects, the entrepreneurs and the builders!

During four weeks students at Hyper Island will explore code and and bridge the gap between the screen and the present. The project will be split into two challenges: [Generative Design of Data](brief/generative-design-of-data.md) \(week 20-21\) and [Hello New World](brief/hello-new-world.md) \(week 22-23\). 

Each challenge will start with a full-day workshop, and students who wishes to follow a steady learning curve can choose to work on a learning assignment for the first week, in order to get going. The challenges also come with a list of optional achievements that can be grabbed.

_The work from the first challenge can be continued and developed under the umbrella of the second challenge._

### Workshops

Workshops will follow a simple **Learn Build & Test** structure with theory and practice in rapid succession. This means that students are always expected to code during workshops, and learning assignments will be tightly connected to theory presented. _There will be bonus workshops during the project which students can join by the end of the day._

### Questions

In order to facilitate situations where neither Internet nor the self is able to find the way forward, there is the Slack workspace!

1. Join the channel that fits your topic eg. \#help-p5 or \#help-a-frame
2. State your question in 1 post, be clear with your goal and what you tried eg "I want to do X and tried Y" while including ample source code to solve the issue.

The Industry Leaders will answer well written questions with equally qualitative answers.

### Class Website

Back in the day, the Digital Media \(before they became creative\) students would, prior to their internship, launch their class into the world with a website. It was a way to stand united and to be collectively more interesting than the individual, while relieving some of the pressure of the portfolio. 

For Exploring Code, a small group will be responsible for building a class website where all deliverables are presented, and communicated.

1. Create an exhibition and class website team
2. Register domain eg. fed21.dev or exploring-code.dev
3. Setup web framework for content submission
