# Welcome

We are not as ticklish when we tickle ourselves, instead the tickling seem to happen at its most powerful when it is by someone else. The sensation we experience equals the difference between what we expect to receive, and what we actually receive. Technology is constantly tickling us, sometimes we laugh out of joy, but most of the time it is making us uncomfortable.

We explore technology, not to eradicate this sensation, but to understand it better, and to highlight the humanity within tech. And to remedy the increasing knowledge gap between those who build machines, and those who use them. 

This open-source learning platform is available to everyone, and is in constant flux. Feel free to use it and contribute!
