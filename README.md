# Introduction

Technology is the new religion. We willingly build algorithms that enslave us, and interfaces that offer little resistance. Instead of _surfing the web_, we swipe aimlessly. **Success!** We have turned the Internet into [Pleasantville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9EHRObUQqY), and we are its numb inhabitants, slaves to the screen.

But has technology brought us closer or further apart? Does an email cost the environment less than a letter? Can "Dark Mode" be seen as innovation? We can do better. **This is our environment**. And here, we are not just the inhabitants, we are also the architects, the entrepreneurs and the builders!

During four weeks students at Hyper Island will explore [creative coding](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/short-courses/stories/how-to-start-creative-coding) and bridge the gap between  screen and present. The project will be split into two separate two-week challenges: [Generative Design of Data](brief/generative-design-of-data.md) and [Hello New World](brief/hello-new-world.md). 

Each challenge will start with a full-day workshop, and students who wish to follow a steady learning curve can choose to work on a learning assignment for the first week, in order to get going. The challenges also come with a list of optional achievements.

_The work from the first challenge can be continued and developed under the umbrella of the second challenge._

### Workshops

Workshops will follow a simple **Learn Build & Test** structure with theory and practice in rapid succession. This means that students are always expected to code during workshops, and learning assignments will be tightly connected to theory presented. _There will be bonus workshops during the project which students can join by the end of the day._

### Talks

Start of your day with an interesting talk! Each week will have at least 1 speaker highlighting a topic within code and design.

### Creative Review & Presentation

Each week there will be a moment to either have review with the Industry Leader, a moment to check on progress and evaluate next steps, or a presentation with the class, sharing the work done so far.

### Questions

In order to facilitate situations where neither Internet nor the self is able to find the way forward, there is the Slack workspace!

1. Join the channel that fits your topic eg. \#help-p5 or \#help-a-frame
2. State your question in 1 post, be clear with your goal and what you tried eg "I want to do X and tried Y" while including ample source code to solve the issue.

The Industry Leaders will answer well written questions with equally qualitative answers.
