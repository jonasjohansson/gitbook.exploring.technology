# Hello world

Welcome to a wishful remedy to the increasing knowledge gap between those who build machines, and those who use them. A repository of complementary learning materials for software, hardware and code, open to everyone.

### Running live workshops during COVID-19

In April we are streaming workshops on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/exploringtechnology) from Friday April 3 to Friday April 17 at mid-day CET every day \(sans weekends\). More information in our [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/524433344931172/).
