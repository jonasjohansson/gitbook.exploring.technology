# Introduction

Technology is the new religion and we are its followers. We willingly build algorithms that conform, and design interfaces that offer little resistance. Instead of _surfing the web_, we swipe aimlessly. **Success!** We have turned the Internet into [Pleasantville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9EHRObUQqY), and we are its numb inhabitants, slaves to the screen.

But has technology brought us closer or further apart? Does an email cost the environment less than a letter? Can "Dark Mode" be seen as innovation? Let's do better. **This is our environment**. We are not just the inhabitants, we are also the architects, the creatives, the entrepreneurs and the builders!

During four weeks, students at Hyper Island will explore [creative coding](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/short-courses/stories/how-to-start-creative-coding) and bridge the gap between screen and present. The project will be split into two separate two-week assignments: [Generative Design of Data](brief/generative-design-of-data.md) and [Hello New World](brief/hello-new-world.md). Assignments are done individually, but within [Learning Groups](info/learning-groups.md) where it is possible to team up \(but not mandatory\).

_The work from the first challenge can be continued and developed under the umbrella of the second challenge._

## On a personal note…

I truly believe code can bring huge positive impact to ourselves, to our communities, to the world. At the same time, I simply enjoy the "act of coding" no matter what it is. I like solving problems. I love riddles. I like movies that offer suspense and twists.

I also believe in community and teams, but at the same time, I am a very much a lone ranger, a soloist. I like other peoples company, but I prefer to be by myself. Now, I know that it's not always the most beneficial to my mental state, and it's definitely not always accelerating my learning, but it's also part of who I am.

This project is designed for you, and I will be here as rock-solid support whenever needed. I am extremely present when I teach, and due to the circumstances, I will try to be so even more - even though remotely. I expect that you will communicate your needs, give this your best, and you can expect that I will do the same.
