# Welcome

Machines have always done what they are told. But the consequences of our human decisions are difficult, and sometimes impossible, too foresee.  We are currently going far in directions where the road is very foggy. We are not as ticklish when we tickle ourselves. The tickling sensation happens at its most powerful when it is by someone else, in a perfectly unexpected way. The tickling sensation equals the difference between what we expect to receive, and what we actually receive. Technology is constantly tickling us, sometimes we laugh out of joy, but most of the time it is making us uncomfortable.

We explore technology, not to eradicate this sensation, but to understand it better, and to highlight the humanity within tech. And to remedy the increasing knowledge gap between those who build machines, and those who use them. 

This open-source learning platform is available to everyone. And has been made through the years from facilitating workshops.
