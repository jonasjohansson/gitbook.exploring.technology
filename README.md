# Introduction

Technology is the new religion and we are its followers. We willingly build algorithms that conform, and design interfaces that offer little resistance. Instead of _surfing the web_, we swipe aimlessly. **Success!** We have turned the Internet into [Pleasantville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9EHRObUQqY), and we are its numb inhabitants, slaves to the screen.

But has technology brought us closer or further apart? Does an email cost the environment less than a letter? Can "Dark Mode" be seen as innovation? Let's do better. **This is our environment**. We are not just the inhabitants, we are also the architects, the creatives, the entrepreneurs and the builders!

During four weeks, students at Hyper Island will explore [creative coding](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/short-courses/stories/how-to-start-creative-coding) and bridge the gap between screen and present. The project will be split into two separate two-week assignments: [Generative Design of Data](brief/generative-design-of-data.md) and [Hello New World](brief/hello-new-world.md). Assignments are done individually, but within [Learning Groups](./#learning-groups) where it is possible to team up \(but not mandatory\).

## Schedule

### Workshops

Workshops will follow a simple **Learn â†’ Build â†’ Test** structure with theory and practice in rapid succession. This means that students are expected to code during workshops, and learning assignments will be closely connected to the theory. 

There will be bonus workshops during the project which students can join by the end of the day.

â†’ [Read about the workshops!](info/workshops.md)

### Talks

Start of your day with an interesting talk! Each week will have at least 1 speaker highlighting a topic within code and design.

### Code Review

_The coding ambulance ðŸš‘has arrived!_

Need help with your code? Unsure if your approach is "the right way"? There will be slots every week where we have a shared video call and try to sort things out. We take questions in the order of people arriving.

Missed the code review? State your question in existing forums:

* [https://stackoverflow.com/](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* [https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5js](https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5js)
* [https://discourse.threejs.org/](https://discourse.threejs.org/)
* [https://aframevr.slack.com/](https://aframevr.slack.com/)

For extra attention link your question in the relevant channel.

Questions should be considered and written in such a way that it is easy to answer without asking for further details. Always include source code \(use the snippet function\), and preferably an **editable** [Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) or [Glitch](http://glitch.com/) link.

Take your time and watch [Let's talk about your creative IQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdsAcNKD9i0&list=PLfJZEI22FEjSXWzbxRfaueY71jiPuFH4V&index=96) with Teo HÃ¤rÃ©n.

### Creative Review & Presentation

Each week there will be a moment to either have review with the Industry Leader, a moment to check on progress and evaluate next steps, or a presentation with the class, sharing the work done so far.

### Learning groups

Will be announced as the project start. Consider filling out the [Remote Work Canvas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h6NfQ07xdu9tq-129YNphhQGCKz371HJTLb4vWCcifY/edit#slide=id.g816f5ffe36_1_213).

### Class representatives

Besides being the unsung heroes, the representatives assist in the structure and facilitation of the project.
