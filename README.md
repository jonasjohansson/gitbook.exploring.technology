# Hello world

We seem to feel a tickling sensation the most when tickled by someone else. The sensation we experience equals the difference between what we expect to receive, and what we actually receive. Technology is constantly tickling us, sometimes we react out of joy, but most of the time it causes discomfort and nervous laughter.

We explore technology, not to eradicate this sensation, but to understand it better;  the human technology, and the tech in humanity. And to remedy the increasing knowledge gap between those who build machines, and those who use them.
