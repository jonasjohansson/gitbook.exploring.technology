#### Background

Some believe the future will look like more of the same — more smartphones, tablets, screens embedded in every conceivable surface. **But as more devices rely solely on sight, voice and hearing we loose a fundamental function - conveying meaning and purpose through form.** Modern solutions by design ignore several of the human capabilities effectively numbing the intellect, while at the same time attempting to accommodate all users through generic presentation. We should not settle for a uniform future dressed in all white, but explore how technology can feel as human as we are. Single purpose artifacts stem from this line of thought — Designs made for someone, instead of everyone.

#### Challenge

Research culture and find \(or manufacture\) a specific use-case where the needs are clear. Create 1 \(or more\) tactile single-purpose artifact that **conveys functionality through form** and combines modern technology into a new experience.

**There is no client**, so no limitations or bounds, except those implied by the chosen scenario. For instance, if the scenario implies wearability, portable power needs to be considered.

#### Presentation

Each team will present their work at a collective exhibition at Hyper Island. All projects will also be published on a dedicated website.

The location of the exhibition is the [Pink Room at Tellusgången 16, 126 37 Hägersten](https://www.google.se/maps/place/Tellusg%C3%A5ngen+16,+126+37+H%C3%A4gersten/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x465f7652ddafb1b9:0x5607cf5e18207a45?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj1v43F1O7QAhVqJsAKHf86Aj0Q8gEIGjAA). Room is accessible from Monday Dec. 19.

#### Deliverables

* A functional prototype
* 1 product shot/hero image in a studio environment
* 1 or more images indicating usage
* Namesign/Logo
* Title
* Concept description \(max 300 words\)
* A1 Poster \(300dpi/CMYK\) outlining the product
  * Create a folder for your team and upload your PDF along with any linked source files: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-wqcijMi8IuVWxzay03ODVkYlU?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-wqcijMi8IuVWxzay03ODVkYlU?usp=sharing). **Files must be in by Monday midnight.**

#### Getting Started

**Create dialogue, not monologue**

To enforce human-system relationships there needs to be feedback. Newton's third law is: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The statement means that in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object equals the size of the force on the second object.

Notifications and signaling systems only offer communication one-way, and while this can definalitely be powerful it's the tip of the iceberg of the sensory range available.

In short: Ignore Twitter and Smartphone notifications.

**Great ideas form while making**

When innovating, rapid iteration is key. Design, Build and Testing exist together and it's not clear where one start and the other begin. Upon finding complex questions a prototype is made to test the hyphothesis. **A functional prototype** is successful as long as it provides an answer that allows progression.

For instance, in order to test the experience between two supposed remote devices it is OK to connect the devices with a physical wire and place the two devices in separated rooms. This will still be able to tell the story and confirm the ideas validity.

**Remembering sensory sensations**

Explore tacticle relationships that contain emotion and personal value. Try to describe what made it so memorable, define its attributes \(eg. hard, soft, fine, rough\) and reflect upon what feelings it created \(eg. comfort, stress, trust, calm\). Bring in these attributes as elements of design and consideration.

Examples could be the feeling of walking barefoot in the warm sand on a beach, sensing the smooth vibration as the skateboard wheels spin effortlessly on fresh pavement or finding the perfect rock for skipping.

**Zoom in and Space out**

The most interesting solutions and ideas exist in unexplored areas. Instead of observing the mundane — Look for specific moments, in specific places, with specific people. Where limitations are strict, creativity flourishes

_"There is in the middle of the forest an unexpected meadow which only he who is lost can find"_ — Thomas Tranströmer

**Combine analog digital with analog**

Critically observe tools and objects around us — What stories do they tell. What's the user journey of a chair, cork-screw opener or a compass?

Why are these objects designed the way they are and what feelings do they instill as they are used. Try and pair digital ways with classic representations.
