### Brief

It is post 2030 and your movement succeeded, well done! You spent many years enjoying the fruit of your labour but with power corrupts and the world is again succumbing to chaos. You are part of the rebellion and in charge for ensuring that your message gets through to the masses. The large numbers of people and the streets you walk are your canvas, but your means are slim and you have to work with what you can find. With a DIY attitude you create signs, apparel add-ons, posters and more to ensure there is a sense of community and a unified front.

Your main expression is visual communication and sound. Use tape, thread, paint and other materials in order to create **your future signage**. Consider your message, the context, the opposition, we don't have much time.

Remember, several years have passed since you were active, you and your team are now seniors and things have changed. Digital mesh technology is alive and breathes in everything we use, from fashion to building blocks to body augmentations. Anything can be a screen, whether it is in OR \(Original Reality\) or AR \(Augmented Reality\). Have this in consideration, but remember what has worked in the past. Just because you're older doesn't mean you have forgotten the trade.

> These kids with their 2030 tech don't know half of itâ€¦ Let's show them how it's done!
