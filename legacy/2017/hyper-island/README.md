# Hyper Island

## Brief

### Assignment

Design and build an Escape room for 2-4 participants. The experience should last 15 minutes \(time remaining must be visually present\) and include 2-3 distinct electronic challenges. The experience must include a game master that can communicate with the participants. You will work in teams of 6-7.

#### Location

All experiences must be located on Floor 4 Left at Hyper Island. Meanwhile, prototype your room with a custom construction using for instance the black building blocks or masking tapeto create boundaries.

#### Narrative

Your Escape room is specific, exciting and immersive. Your story is not happening only during but also before and after the escape room has been entered. Consider the roles of the participants and get inspiration from films, books, history, theatre, games and more.
