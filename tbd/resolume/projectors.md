# Projectors

Understanding projectors is a great aid when planning installations and performances, and the definitive place to start learning is the [Guide to projectors for interactive installations](http://www.creativeapplications.net/tutorials/guide-to-projectors-for-interactive-installations/) from Creative Applications.

A good default setup is a **DLP projector** with **at least 3000 Lumen** and **ST \(Short Throw\)**. 1080p/HD-quality is **not necessary**.

When a projector is chosen, use the [Projection Calculator](http://www.projectorcentral.com/projection-calculator.cfm%20) from Projector Central to understand how far the projector must be placed to cover a certain area \(amongst other things\).
