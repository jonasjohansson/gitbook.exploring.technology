# Resolume

Resolume is an audiovisual performance tool. It enables you to play video, audio and audiovisual clips, mix them with each other, apply effects to them and output the results either for a live performance or for recording.

### Installing Resolume

Download [Resolume Arena](https://resolume.com/download/) \(Avenue does not include advanced projection mapping possibilities\) and run the installation. This is a full package but comes with watermarks on video and audio output unless a license is purchased.

**NOTE:** Mute the sound of the computer to avoid hearing the audio watermark.

### Running Arena

Before moving into the interface of Resolume, perform the following settings to allow a clearer overview:

1. View
   * Untick "Show Audio Controls"
   * Untick "Show Crossfader"
   * Untick "Show Dashboard"
   * Untick "Show Beat Looper"
   * Tick "Show Layer Transition Controls"
   * Tick "Show FFT Gain"
2. Deck
   * Click "Remove" until only 1 deck left
3. Layer
   * Click "Remove" until only 1 layer left
4. Column
   * Click "Remove" until only 3 columns left
5. Composition
   * Click "New"
   * Click "Settings"
   * Name: \[YOUR\_COMPOSITION\_NAME\]
   * Size: If this is your first use 800x600, otherwise mimic the resolution of the projector or monitor. 
   * Click "Apply/Save"

Your composition is saved as an .avc file and can be shared.

#### Layers & Columns

Each column can contain 1 output \(ex. video or image\) and each layer can contain multiple columns. Each layer can only have 1 colum

#### Sources

Instead of video it's possible to code your own sources. Resolume offers a wide selection of pre-made sources such as Lines, Rings and more.

#### Effects

The list of effects can be found in the bottom right. To add an effect, drag and drop it on the video clip, the layer or the composition tab.

Here's a list of the most useful effects:

#### Image adjustment

* Add Subtract
* Auto Mask
* Blur
* Bright.Contrast
* ChromaKey
* Colorize
* Crop
* Flip
* Hue rotate
* Keystone
* Levels
* Mirror
* Recolour
* Saturation
* Solid Color
* Stripper
* Threshold
* Tint
* Vignette

#### Visual FX

* Displace
* Distortion
* Goo
* Shift Glitch
* Trails
* Twisted
* Wave Warp

**Pro tip:** To avoid confusion add effects to the composition, and to the layer when absolutely necessary.

### Adding files

It is possible to "drag and drop" files directly to Resolume, but the suggested way is to use the File Browser in the bottom right. Navigate to the folder containing the relevant media.

A suggested structure for organisation is:

* MY\_VIDEO\_FOLDER
  * ORIGINAL
    * my\_source\_file.mp4
  * EDITED
    * my\_edited\_file-1.mp4
    * my\_edited\_file-2.mp4
    * my\_edited\_file-3.mp4
  * ENCODED
    * my\_encoded\_file-1.mov
    * my\_encoded\_file-2.mov
    * my\_encoded\_file-3.mov

**Pro tip:** If the file does not play change the extension to "mov" \(Quicktime\).
