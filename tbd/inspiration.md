[https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) - Can’t stress this enough, Shiffman is a really great quirky individual committed to getting artists and students into programming. Please take close look at his youtube and vimeo channel, also he’s written some books on the matter. Pretty much every topic gets explained, from super basic to quite advanced. [http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596154158.do](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596154158.do) - For me this has been a really important book to get into programming, it teaches a combination of Arduino, Processing and openFrameworks [http://www.makershed.com/collections/books](http://www.makershed.com/collections/books) - Make magazine produces really nice books on specific topics, as well as general ‘get into Arduino/Raspberry Pi/drones/etc

[http://natureofcode.com/](http://natureofcode.com/) - Also by shiffman, a bit more advanced, but a great book and site that shows how to use Processing for nature-inspired programming [http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/) - This book has been a massive influence on my perception of creativity and technology, it is also co-written by Julia Laub, she’s one of the founders of onformative, the studio I’m a member of in Berlin. \(edited\)

#### The art of asking questions

It's difficult to ask great questions, but spending the extra time to think before action will reap great rewards. Remember that a vague question will provide a vague answer, and to the greatest extent, find the answer on your own. Google is your friend and great search queries will be your savior. If you've exhausted all possibilities, use online forums. Your last resort is to ask someone in your close proximity.
