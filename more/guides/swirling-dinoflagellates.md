# Swirling Dinoflagellates

Dinoflagellates single-celled protists, a diverse collection of **organisms**, part of the **plankton** community and usually considered **algae**. Dinoflagellates are capable of **photosynthesis** \(converting light energy into "fuel"\) and are thus considered plants. Some exhibit bioluminescence, a process involving a light-emitting molecule and an enzyme, generally called the luciferin \(coined by[ RaphaÃ«l Dubois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapha%C3%ABl_Dubois)\).

Dinoflagellates can be cultivated and purchased from places such as [Pyrofarms](https://pyrofarms.com/) \(US\) and [Bioglow](https://bioglow.eu/) \(Europe\).

Pyrofarms provide excellent instructions and information:

## Altering Circadian Rhythm

Dinoflagellates perform photosynthesis during daytime hours and only produce the light during their dark cycle at night. Program the light timer for 12 hours of light and make sure they are in the dark during the other 12 hour cycle. It usually takes a couple of days, maybe a week, before they begin to change their cycle.
