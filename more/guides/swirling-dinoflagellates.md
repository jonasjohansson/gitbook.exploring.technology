# Swirling Dinoflagellates

Dinoflagellates single-celled protists, a diverse collection of **organisms**, part of the **plankton** community and usually considered **algae**. Dinoflagellates are capable of **photosynthesis** \(converting light energy into chemical energy, which can be released to fuel the organism\) and are thus considered plants. Some exhibit bioluminescence, a process involving a light-emitting molecule and an enzyme, generally called the luciferin \(coined by[ Raphaël Dubois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapha%C3%ABl_Dubois), a French pharmacologist known for his work on bioluminescence\).

Dinoflagellates can be cultivated and purchased from places such as [Pyrofarms](https://pyrofarms.com/) \(US\) and [Bioglow](https://bioglow.eu/) \(Europe\). 

Much of these instructions are copied from the [Pyrofarms instruction page](https://pyrofarms.com/pages/pyrodino-instructions). Read also [their description of dinoflagellates](https://pyrofarms.com/pages/what-is-a-dinoflagellate).

## Growing Dinos

### Light & Heat

* PyroDinos **require daily light** and moderate temperatures to survive. They will not survive without daily light for more than 4 or 5 consecutive days.
* **NO direct sunlight** or any lighting that adds heat. When in doubt, place in an area of the room that receives low to moderate lighting.
* Ideal Temperature is 17-26°C. Try to minimise temperature fluctuations.

### Food

* Feeding should only be performed with provided nutrients. Dinoflagellates are a marine \(saltwater\) species and can be added to a saltwater fish or coral tank.

### Air

* It is beneficial \(but not required\) to loosen the cap during daytime hours. The goal is to increase air-exchange while limiting evaporation.
* It is beneficial \(but not required\) to gently swirl PyroDinos once a day, during daytime hours \(with the cap tightly closed\).

## Altering Circadian Rhythm

Dinoflagellates perform photosynthesis during daytime hours and only produce the light during their dark cycle at night. Program the light timer for 12 hours of light and make sure they are in the dark during the other 12 hour cycle. It usually takes a couple of days, maybe a week, before they begin to change their cycle.
