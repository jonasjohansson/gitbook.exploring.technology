# Slime Mold

## Background

An informal name given to several kinds of unrelated [eukaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic) organisms that can live freely as single cells, but can aggregate together to form multicellular reproductive structures. Slime molds were formerly classified as [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi) but are no longer considered part of that [kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_%28biology%29). Although not forming a single monophyletic clade, they are grouped within the [paraphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly) group referred to as kingdom [Protista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protists).

More than 900 species of slime mold occur all over the world. Their common name refers to part of some of these organisms' life cycles where they can appear as gelatinous "slime". This is mostly seen with the [Myxogastria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxogastria), which are the only macroscopic slime molds. Most slime molds are smaller than a few centimeters, but some species may reach sizes of up to several square meters and masses of up to 30 grams.

Many slime molds, mainly the "cellular" slime molds, do not spend most of their time in this state. As long as food is abundant, these slime molds exist as single-celled organisms. When food is in short supply, many of these single-celled organisms will congregate and start moving as a single body. In this state they are sensitive to airborne chemicals and can detect food sources. They can readily change the shape and function of parts and may form stalks that produce fruiting bodies, releasing countless spores, light enough to be carried on the wind or hitch a ride on passing animals.

They feed on [microorganisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganisms) that live in any type of dead plant material. They contribute to the decomposition of dead vegetation, and feed on bacteria, yeasts, and fungi. For this reason, slime molds are usually found in [soil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil), [lawns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn), and on the [forest floor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_floor), commonly on [deciduous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous) logs. However, in [tropical areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics) they are also common on [inflorescences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflorescences) and [fruits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit), and in aerial situations \(e.g., in the canopy of trees\). In urban areas, they are found on [mulch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulch) or even in the [leaf mold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_mold) in [rain gutters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_gutter), and also grow in air conditioners, especially when the drain is blocked.

### Protoplasm

The colourless material comprising the living part of a cell, including the cytoplasm, nucleus, and other organelles.

Protoplasm, the cytoplasm and nucleus of a cell. The term was first defined in 1835 as the ground substance of living material and, hence, responsible for all living processes. Advocates of the protoplasm concept implied that cells were either fragments or containers of protoplasm. The weakness of the concept was its inability to account for the origin of formed structures within the cell, especially the nucleus. Today the term is used to mean simply the cytoplasm and nucleus. The word protoplasm is somewhat unpopular in modern biology, although the term protoplasmic streaming is commonly used to describe the movement of the cytoplasm.
