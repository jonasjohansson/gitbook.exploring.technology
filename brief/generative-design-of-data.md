# ðŸ¥ˆ Generative Design of Data

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note to self: This will be simplified, perhaps work with terms surrounding maps, and relate to travel, information intake, filtering etc. 
{% endhint %}

Data is powerful. On one hand it appears as graphs and numbers, turning people into statistics, and on the other it appears as detailed maps that help us understand our environment.

Kaggle, the world's largest data science community, urges people to [Help us better understand COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/covid19) and offer their massive datasets. At the same time, museums \(physical datasets\) are struggling to share their information with the world.

Hans Rosling, who turned data science from boring to interesting

## Challenge

How we present information matter. Your challenge is in creating a Generative ****and Interactive Audiovisual Artwork ****driven by Data:

1. Decide on a dataset or API to drive your work. The data can be implemented programmatically or manually.
2. Express the data through audio, visuals and interaction.
3. Make your work public using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Glitch](http://glitch.com/) or the [P5 editor](https://editor.p5js.org/). You may also choose your own hosting solution.

### Optional
