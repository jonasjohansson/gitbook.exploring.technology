# ðŸ¥ˆ Generative Design of Data

As we bombard each other with graphs and numbers, people slowly turn into statistics used to demonstrate a country's greatness or weakness. But reality is complex. Kaggle, the world's largest data science community urges people "[Help us better understand COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/covid19)" and provides a huge section of datasets. 

### Challenge

How we present information matters and you are challenged with creating a Generative ****and Interactive Audiovisual Artwork ****driven by Data.

1. Decide on a dataset or API to drive your work. The data can be implemented programmatically or manually.
2. Express the data through audio, visuals and interaction.
3. Make your work public using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Glitch](http://glitch.com/) or the [P5 editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).

{% hint style="info" %}
An introduction to generative design and P5 will be held at the beginning of the project, but it is free to choose other libraries to work with.

## Deliverables

Build 1 \(or more\) audiovisual data experience, either as an individual or as a team.
