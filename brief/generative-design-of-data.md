# ðŸ¥ˆ Game Companion

{% hint style="warning" %}
This text is a draft.
{% endhint %}

_During quarantine we have stayed in our rooms, apartments, houses. We've stared at the same walls, walked the same steps, played the same games._

### Challenge

Upgrade a traditional game experience using digital technology, or perhaps even create a meta-game within the game; Can there be an additional Twister winner based on the amount of trash talking that occurs, or can a game of chess generate sound and visuals? What if UNO had Magic the Gathering qualities, and stories displayed in AR?

1. Decide on a traditional game experience. It should be tangible.
2. Use technologies learnt in workshops, and create a "game companion" in the form of a mobile/desktop application and/or physical prototype.
3. Present your work as a playable experience and invite your friends!
