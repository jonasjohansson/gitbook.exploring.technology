Back in the day, the Digital Media \(before they became creative\) students would, prior to their internship, launch their class into the world with a website. It was a way to stand united and to be collectively more interesting than the individual. For Exploring Code, a small group will be responsible for building a class website where all deliverables are presented, and communicated.

1. Create an exhibition and class website team
2. Register domain eg. fed21.dev or exploring-code.dev
3. Setup web framework for content submission
