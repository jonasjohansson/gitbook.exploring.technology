# ü•á Hello New World

While quarantined we are undergoing change, and what will come after is uncertain. Will we be more or less open to others, will we change the way we travel and behave? What is certain, however, is that that is a new normal and there is a need of new ways of using digital technology to experience, communicate, collaborate and create.

The are several initiatives addressing this already, such as the open call from [Culture of Solidarity](https://www.culturalfoundation.eu/culture-of-solidarity) and [Vinnova](https://www.vinnova.se/)'s request for [innovation](https://www.vinnova.se/e/innovationer-i-krisens-spar/2020).

## Challenge

Virtual and Augmented has recently reached the mobile browser, and both allow us to re-imagine our immediate environment. Your challenge is to build a VR or AR "portal" that spark curiosity, creativity and interaction, using smartphone\(s\).  Find your area of interest and have someone/something specific in mind.

Remember, [don't think big!](https://blog.prototypr.io/dont-think-big-5ca8e7dd8b3d#.fcx0aw7el)

### VR

Build 1 \(or more\) interactive VR experience, either as an individual or as a team. Prototype it using sponsored headsets \([Oculus Go](https://www.oculus.com/go)\) from [Immersivt](https://www.immersivt.se/).

### AR

Build 1 \(or more\) interactive AR experience, either as an individual or as a team. Design your own marker and hack your surroundings by putting it up wherever you see fit, or build a system that allows for others to create their own.
