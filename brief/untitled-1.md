# ü•á Portals

Confined in our apartment, our city, our country we are undergoing a change. And what will come after is uncertain. What is certain, however, is that that is a new normal - not a break - and there is a need of new ways of using digital technology to experience, communicate, collaborate and create.

The [European Cultural Foundation](https://www.culturalfoundation.eu/) recently closed the [Culture of Solidarity open call](https://www.culturalfoundation.eu/culture-of-solidarity) which addresses this, and [Vinnova](https://www.vinnova.se/) is looking for [innovations to Mitigate the Crisis](https://www.vinnova.se/e/innovationer-i-krisens-spar/2020), with new open calls each month. There has been two huge hack events: [Hack the Crisis](https://www.hackthecrisis.se/) and [EU vs Virus](https://euvsvirus.org/) and more are to come.

Virtual and Augmented Reality have been available for quite some time now, but it's not until recently that it has reached high potential using the mobile browser. Both technologies allow us to hack our immediate environment, whether it is by transporting us to a completely new place, or by using markers to make things appear in the real world.

Your challenge is to build a VR or AR "portal" that spark curiosity, creativity and interaction, using smartphones. You will have a workshop in building 3D experiences using [A-Frame](https://www.exploring.technology/learn/aframe) and [AR.js](https://www.exploring.technology/learn/aframe/ar).

Remember, [don't think big!](https://blog.prototypr.io/dont-think-big-5ca8e7dd8b3d#.fcx0aw7el)

### Deliverables AR

Build 1 \(or more\) interactive AR experiences, either as an individual or as a team. Design your own marker and hack your surroundings. [GOTO10](https://www.goto10.se/) has offered to print these in large size and display in their window, and they can also be put up on the public walls at [Sn√∂s√§tra Wall of Fame](https://www.visitstockholm.com/sv/se--gora/sevardheter/snosatra-graffiti-wall-of-fame/).
