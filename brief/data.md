# ðŸ¥ˆ Generative Design

We are bombarded with information, graphs and numbers. People are turned into statistics, and countries measure their prowess by the power of integers. **It's abstract**. Not all is obvious, nor black and white. Reality is complex.

Kaggle, the world's largest data science community urges people "[Help us better understand COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/covid19)" and provides a huge section of datasets. There's also the [Awesome Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) along with [Open Stockholm](https://dataportalen.stockholm.se/dataportalen/). 

Your challenge is to create a **generative audiovisual artwork** driven by **data** and **triggered** by an event \(could be an input from a user, or from somewhere else\). Discover the data that drives you, and code an experience that informs the visitor of that information, using sound and visuals.

## Deliverables
