# ðŸ¥ˆ We Feel Fine

We are bombarded with information, graphs and numbers. People are turned into statistics, and countries measure their prowess by the power of integers. **It's abstract**. Not all is obvious, nor black and white. Reality is complex.

Kaggle, the world's largest data science community urges people "[Help us better understand COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/covid19)" and provides a huge section of datasets. There's also the [Awesome Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) along with [Open Stockholm](https://dataportalen.stockholm.se/dataportalen/) \(and the weird [Webbkameror](http://www.webbkameror.se/)\).

Nicolas Feltron, Jonathan Harris.

Your challenge is to use data and present it in a new and interesting light the outputs available to you \(sound and vision\).
