# ðŸ¥ˆ Generative Design

We are bombarded with information, graphs and numbers. People are turned into statistics, and countries measure their prowess by the power of integers. **It's abstract**. Not all is obvious, nor black and white. Reality is complex.

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), the world's largest data science community urges people "[Help us better understand COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/covid19)" and provides a huge section of datasets. There's also the [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) along with [Open Stockholm](https://dataportalen.stockholm.se/dataportalen/) \(and the weird [Webbkameror](http://www.webbkameror.se/)\).

Data-driven Audiovisual interactive design

**Generative design** is an [iterative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration) [design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design) [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_%28engineering%29) that involves a [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) that will [generate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_%28mathematics%29) a certain number of [outputs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output_%28computing%29) that meet certain [constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_%28mathematics%29), and a [designer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designer) that will fine tune the [feasible region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region) by changing [minimal and maximal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima) values of an [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28mathematics%29) in which a [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_%28mathematics%29) of the program meets the [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_%28mathematics%29) of constraints, in order to reduce or augment the number of outputs to [choose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice) from.

Generative design is based on rules

Due to those boundaries we were given classics like Tetris and Pong. Easy to play, difficult to master. 30 years later the lust for "better graphics" have decreased, and there has been for many years a re-surge of story driven experiences, and games that are built solely on minimal mechanics.

Science and facts drive a lot of the change we see, but it is truly our perception of these that matter as well. If
