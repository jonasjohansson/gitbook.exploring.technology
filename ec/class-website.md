# ðŸ¥‰ Class Website

Back in the day the Hyper Island students would create a collective website prior to their internship. It was a way to build a unified front that created interest for the students as a unity, rather than individually. For Exploring Code, a small group will be responsible for building a class website where all deliverables are presented.
