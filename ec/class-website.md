# ðŸ¥‰ Class Website

The old hyper Island tradition of building a class website is being brought back by the Frontend Developers. An exhibition team will be made with the  sole responsibility to create and maintain a class website which will contain all the works made during the project, and be communicated externally from Hyper Island.
