# A \(not so\) Brief History

HTML has been around for 30 years, providing building blocks for all browser experiences. 5 years after, JavaScript and CSS came along, improving both functionality and aesthetics. Since then, this triad can be found anywhere there is a browser.

Along with an increase in web sites followed an explosion of users, and we begin studying user interface design at an increasing scale \([Designing Web Usability](https://www.nngroup.com/books/designing-web-usability/) and [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/) anyone?\). We began seeing responsive CSS styles, terms like [graceful degradation and progressive enhancement](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement). We swore at Internet Explorer and had to write things like this:

```markup
<!--[if !IE]> -->
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheets/no-ie.css">
<!-- <![endif]-->
```

1999 and onwards we realised that instead of building web sites we could create **web systems** and the blog was born with Wordpress \(2003\) moving from personal platform to the number one CMS for companies. _And along came e-commerce and Facebookâ€¦_

2007 the smartphone arrived in our hand, and suddenly we had to consider touch and all the other inputs that a smartphone had \(sound, video, light, GPS, motion\). This made the browser **become personal**. Flash was killed and made space for [JQuery](https://jquery.org/) and a hurricane of libraries assisting in building engaging interfaces.

2009 [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) made an entrance allowing JavaScript to communicate with the operative system and connected devices. JavaScript was not breathing the same air as Python and other programming languages. The cage is unlocked.

2011 [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) is launched, demonstrating the huge interest in data driven experiences, and chaining tools. We automate experiences and use API's back and forth. _Remember when the Twitter API was completely open? That was nuts!_

2013 [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) were released, as a response to keeping web technologies relevant and more useful than ever as native applications for both mobile and desktop could be made with only one framework. A few years prior, [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) \(now [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)\) was already around, enabling beautiful  and interactive experiences in the browser.

As code bases grew, sanity had to be kept. We began working heavily with GIT, CSS pre-compilers \([SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)\), task runners and module bundlers \(think [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)\). We built [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/) and later [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and "vanilla JavaScript" become a search term.

2014 the ESP8266 was released, a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip enabling microcontrollers to gain access to the web. Together with Bluetooth Low Energy everything became connected, and Internet of \([Enchanted](http://enchantedobjects.com/)\) Things got cheer leader level popularity. It's not difficult to imagine the rise of the voice assistant following along.

2015 and onward we being working with push states and service workers, making web sites feel native \(no reload\). This is something we are still looking at today with the surge of Progressive Web Applications \(PWA\), which has led to todays interest in [SVELTE](https://svelte.dev/) and [FLUTTER](https://flutter.dev/). 

2016 [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) was created in order to allow web developers and designers to author 3D and VR experiences with HTML. Two years later the Oculus Go is released, a VR headset that can view VR experiences in the browser.

2018 [ML5](https://ml5js.github.io/) simplified the process of using machine learning, and combined with [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) creating your own datasets is a breeze.

A lot more has happened of course, we use [Glitch](http://glitch.com/) for writing collaborative code, published immediately. And instead of dynamic sites we use Static Site Generators such as [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

_If web development once was a box of wonders, it has scaled into a universe._

If you are getting started, it can be overwhelming. But what's great is, it's all still HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And on that front, not much has fundamentally changed. **Learn the basics.**
