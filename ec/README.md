# Exploring Code

Technology is the new religion. We build algorithms that enslave us and interfaces that offer little resistance, and few moments of learning. Instead of _surfing the web_, we swipe aimlessly. **Success!** We have turned the Internet into [Pleasantville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9EHRObUQqY), and we are its numb inhabitants.

But has technology brought us closer? Does an email cost less than a letter? Can "Dark Mode" be seen as innovation? We can do better. **This is our environment**. And here, we are not just the inhabitants, we are also the architects, the entrepreneurs and the builders!

During four weeks students at Hyper Island will explore code and and bridge the gap between humans and machines, using play and alternative interfaces.

In order to further facilitate learning the four weeks will be used for two projects, with project having a **Conceptual** or **Technical** track.

a mid delivery in the shape of a three-day sprint project will train students in the art of making choices and delivering a solid experience and presentation. All training wheels are then removed as the teams work towards the final project, an exhibition encouraging participation, imagination, activation and transformation.

> The students will get to create outside the norm and challenge the way interfaces are built. Art, music, virtual reality experiences - the possibilities are endless. Hands-on creation, testing the limits and insights of the creative process. — Hyper Island
