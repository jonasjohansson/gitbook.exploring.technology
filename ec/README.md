# Exploring Code

Technology is the new religion. We build algorithms that enslave us and interfaces that offer little resistance, and few moments of learning. Instead of _surfing the web_, we swipe aimlessly. **Success!** We have turned the Internet into [Pleasantville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9EHRObUQqY), and we are its numb inhabitants.

But has technology brought us closer? Does an email cost less than a letter? Can "Dark Mode" be seen as innovation? We can do better. **This is our environment**. And here, we are not just the inhabitants, we are also the architects, the entrepreneurs and the builders!

During four weeks students at Hyper Island will explore code and and bridge the gap between humans and machines, using play and alternative interfaces.

> The students will get to create outside the norm and challenge the way interfaces are built. Art, music, virtual reality experiences - the possibilities are endless. Hands-on creation, testing the limits and insights of the creative process. — Hyper Island

### Workshops

Define your teams attributes by attending the workshops you feel are relevant to you. Put all your points into an attribute and specialise, or find balance by having a generalist approach.

### Questions

In order to facilitate situations where neither Internet nor the self is able to find the way forward, there is the Slack workspace!

1. Join the \# channel that fits your topic eg. \#help-p5 or \#help-a-frame
2. State your question in 1 post, be clear with your goal and what you tried eg "I want to do X and tried Y" while including ample source code to solve the issue.

The Industry Leaders will answer well written questions with equally qualitative answers.
