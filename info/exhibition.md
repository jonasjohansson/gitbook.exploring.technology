# Exhibition



[GOTO10](https://www.goto10.se/) has offered to help print work produced and display in their window. Prints can also be put up on the public grafitti walls at [Snösätra](https://www.visitstockholm.com/sv/se--gora/sevardheter/snosatra-graffiti-wall-of-fame/).

_If we print_ [_temporary AR tattoos_](http://snabbkopiering.se/trycksaker/) _I'd be very happy._

We will also print all markers and designs in a physical newspaper using [Newspaper Club](https://www.newspaperclub.com/)!

## Class Website

Back in the day, the Digital Media \(before they became creative\) students would, prior to their internship, launch their class into the world with a website. It was a way to stand united and to be collectively more interesting than the individual, while relieving some of the pressure of the portfolio. 

For Exploring Code, a small group will be responsible for building a class website where all deliverables are presented, and communicated.

1. Create an exhibition and class website team
2. Register domain eg. fed21.dev or exploring-code.dev
3. Setup web framework for content submission
