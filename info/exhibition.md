# Exhibition

[GOTO10](https://www.goto10.se/) has offered to help print work produced and display in their window. Prints can also be put up on the public grafitti walls at [Snösätra](https://www.visitstockholm.com/sv/se--gora/sevardheter/snosatra-graffiti-wall-of-fame/).

_If we print_ [_temporary AR tattoos_](http://snabbkopiering.se/trycksaker/) _I'd be very happy._

We will also print all markers and designs in a physical newspaper using [Newspaper Club](https://www.newspaperclub.com/)!

## Process

Back in the day, the Digital Media \(before they became creative\) students would, prior to their internship, launch their class into the world with a website. It was a way to stand united and to be collectively more interesting than the individual, while relieving some of the pressure of the portfolio.  

During Exploring Code we will do something similar with a process site where all works will be displayed. This site will be the go to space for all external communication, and live on long after the module is finished.
