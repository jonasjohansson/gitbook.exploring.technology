# Review

## Code Review

Debugging is difficult, and sometimes it's hard to even understand what to look for. Tempting as it may be, it is wise to practice üêõ elimination while also becoming more **self-reliant**. Here's the order I suggest you follow when challenged:

1. Ask yourself
2. Ask yourself again \(and really think about it\)
3. Ask a friend directly
4. Ask in Slack
5. Ask the Internet
6. Join code review and ask Jonas

"But I want to get the answer now!"

You'd be surprised how fast people at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) responds \(sometimes minutes\), and you should be able to park a problem for a while and not let it stop your progress. **Get some fresh air!**

There are also other reasons for asking publicly:

1. Those with similar problems may get help from the comments.
2. You may get a wide range of answers that solve problems further down the line.
3. You improve your ability to analyse a problem and write a concise question.

With that said, there will be Code Review each week where we try to find solutions together, without any pressure. Just join in and we take it as it comes.

Also, take your time and watch [Let's talk about your creative IQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdsAcNKD9i0&list=PLfJZEI22FEjSXWzbxRfaueY71jiPuFH4V&index=96) with Teo H√§r√©n. It's a small reminder on how our brain tends to look for the easy way out.

## Creative Review & Presentation

Each week there will be a moment to either have review with the Industry Leader, or a presentation with the class, sharing the work done so far.

What is a review? We look at your concept and progress so far, without judgment, with the only purpose to assist you in moving forward. We are trying to solve hurdles creatively, and reviewing your ideas looking at potential.
