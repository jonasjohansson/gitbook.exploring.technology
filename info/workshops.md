# Workshops

Workshops follow a simple **Learn → Build → Test** structure with theory and practice in rapid succession. This means that students are expected to code during workshops, and learning assignments will be closely connected to the theory.

## Bonus ✨

These are optional sprint workshops for those who are curious to learn special topics.

### Machine Learning

Teach a machine using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and integrate it using [ML5](https://ml5js.org/) and [P5](https://p5js.org/). This workshop will demonstrate how to use Audio, Video and Pose data to create web interactions!

### Internet of Things

Interact with reality by building your own data driven project, using an [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) device to a public Internet hotspot! Teams interested in using this may receive a package with all required components for a first project.

### Python

Get an introduction to the wonderful language of Python while building a simple API. 

With [Eskil Fogelström](talks.md#eskil-fogelstroem).

### Electron

Learn how to your web development knowledge to build desktop apps using Use Node.js and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)! Check out the [list of apps](https://www.electronjs.org/apps) made in Electron \(for instance Slack\).
