# Workshops

Workshops follow a simple **Learn → Build → Test** structure with theory and practice in rapid succession. This means that students are expected to code during workshops, and learning assignments will be closely connected to the theory. 

### [Generative Design](https://www.exploring.technology/learn/p5)

Learn the basics of building data-driven and interactive audiovisual experiences using [P5](https://p5js.org/).

### [Makey Makey](https://www.exploring.technology/learn/makey-makey)

Build your own interactive narratives using Bitsy, the small emulator for small worlds! It's all HTML and can be hacked with some very fun Javascript-snippets.

### [Mixed Reality](https://www.exploring.technology/learn/aframe)

Build alternative realities in AR and VR with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)!  

→ [Create an account on Glitch](https://start.exploring.technology/tools/glitch)

### [Machine Learning](https://www.exploring.technology/learn/machine-learning)

Teach a machine using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and integrate it using [ML5](https://ml5js.org/) and [P5](https://p5js.org/). This workshop will demonstrate how to use **Audio**, **Video** and **Pose** to create web interactions!
