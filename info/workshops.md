# Workshops

Workshops follow a simple **Learn → Build → Test** structure with theory and practice in rapid succession. This means that students are expected to code during workshops, and learning assignments will be closely connected to the theory.

### \*\*\*\*[Generative Design](https://www.exploring.technology/learn/p5)

Learn the basics of building data-driven and interactive audiovisual browser experiences using [P5](https://p5js.org/).

→ [Create an account on P5](https://editor.p5js.org/)

### [Mixed Reality](https://www.exploring.technology/learn/aframe)

Build alternative realities in AR and VR with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)!  

→ [Create an account on Glitch](https://start.exploring.technology/tools/glitch)

### [Makey Makey](https://www.exploring.technology/learn/makey-makey)

Build your own tactile instruments and interfaces with Makey Makey, an Arduino clone focused on capacitive touch, the technology that turns everything that is conductive into an input!

### [Machine Learning](https://www.exploring.technology/learn/machine-learning)

Teach a machine using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and integrate it using [ML5](https://ml5js.org/) and [P5](https://p5js.org/). This workshop will demonstrate how to use **Audio**, **Video** and **Pose** to create web interactions.

### [Laser Cutting](https://www.exploring.technology/learn/laser-cutting)

Introduction to the laser cutter where participants will learn about the fantastic world of rapid fabrication and laser. while going from digital illustrations to physical reproductions.
