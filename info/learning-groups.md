# Learning Groups

Will be announced as the project start. Consider filling out the [Remote Work Canvas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h6NfQ07xdu9tq-129YNphhQGCKz371HJTLb4vWCcifY/edit#slide=id.g816f5ffe36_1_213).

Things to ask yourselves as you get going:

* How do I feel about this Module? 
* What would I like to learn/get out from it? 
* How would I like to challenge myself? 
* What support would I like to get from you? 
* What support would I like to give to you? 
* How would I like us to work together? 
* Talk about practicalities: How/when will you connect? \(checkins-outs, etc\) 
* Have a Learning Group Leader? \(if so, what do you need from that role?\)
