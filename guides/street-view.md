# Street View

Install [Street View](https://www.google.com/streetview/) for either [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-street-view/id904418768) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.street&hl=en).

Once installed, follow these steps:

1. Open the app and skip the introduction.
2. Tap the camera icon in the bottom right and select "Take Photo Sphere".
3. Find each orange circle and take a picture. Once the check mark is green, hit it.
4. Finally, open the image and click the "Share" icon in the bottom right and select "Save Image".

The 360 panorama image should now be in the photos folder.
