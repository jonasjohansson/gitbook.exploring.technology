# 5. Playing audio files

We have taken a first look at generating \(or _synthesizing_\) sound, and now it's time to master audio file playback. In Tone.js an easy way to do this is using the [`Tone.Player`](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/13.8.25/Player). Let's create one and play it when it has loaded.

```javascript
function setup() {
  Tone.Master.volume.value = -24
  
  const player = new Tone.Player({
    url: 'https://www.alexanderwallin.com/audio/pad-4.ogg',
    onload: function() {
      player.start()
    }
  })
  player.connect(Tone.Master)
}
```

That's should play a short but cute synth sample. We can `restart()` it whenever we want, perhaps inside `mouseClicked()`?

```javascript
// player needs to be out here now
let player

function setup() {
  Tone.Master.volume.value = -24
  
  player = new Tone.Player({
    url: 'https://www.alexanderwallin.com/audio/pad-4.ogg',
    onload: function() {
      player.start()
    }
  })
  player.connect(Tone.Master)
}

function mouseClicked() {
  player.restart()
}
```

Click the canvas and Bob will be your uncle! We can also make it loop, fade in and out and even play in reverse! You can always take a look in the docs to see what options are available.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are more advanced playback tools like [`Tone.Sampler`](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/13.8.25/Sampler), but we will stop here for now.
