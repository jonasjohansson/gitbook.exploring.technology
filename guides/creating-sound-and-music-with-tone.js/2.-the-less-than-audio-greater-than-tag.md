# 2. The &lt;audio&gt; tag

The simplest possible way to play a bit of audio is using the HTML5 `<audio>` tag. In its simplest form, it looks much like an `<img>` tag:

```markup
<audio src="https://www.alexanderwallin.com/audio/pad-5.ogg" controls />
```

This will render a basic player:

Different browsers support different file formats, where wav, .ogg and .mp3 are most common. As .wav files are uncompressed and therefor huge in filesize, and .mp3 sometimes need licensing to use commercially, .ogg is a good alternative.

To be sure to cover all grounds you can specify multiple sources:

```markup
<audio controls>
  <source src="https://www.alexanderwallin.com/audio/pad-5.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  <source src="https://www.alexanderwallin.com/audio/pad-5.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <source src="https://www.alexanderwallin.com/audio/pad-5.wav" type="audio/wav" />
</audio>
```

### Limitations

In JavaScript, you can subscribe to different events on the `<audio>` tag, but there's for instance no way of playing or pausing it programmatically. For that we need other tools!
