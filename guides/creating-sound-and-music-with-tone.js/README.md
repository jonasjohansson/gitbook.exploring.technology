# Creating sound and music with Tone.js

In this tutorial we will learn how to create and play sounds in the browser using Tone.js. By combining different sound sources and running them though effects we can quickly create something musical. We will use the keyboard and mouse to play and interact with our music, and lastly create simple visuals in p5 reacting on the audio.

We will not be learning Web Audio API fundamentals, as the main focus here is to get going and get playing! As several other official JavaScript APIs, it is quite verbose and can be awkward in the beginning. Hopefully, once you've played with Tone.js it will be easier to grasp the Web Audio API if you want to dive deeper.

### Sounds inventory

Here are two sources to find sounds to play in the upcoming tasks:
