# ðŸ•¹ DIY Music Machine

With a few tools in our tool belt it's time to put something together. It doesn't have to be complex!

The task is to play one or more sounds in an interactive way and make some kind of visual reaction. Here are a few pointers:

* Start out simple and expand as you go
* Find your own sounds to make it more personal
* Use the `Tone.Meter` to make the visuals feel alive
* Check out the [Tone.js examples page](https://tonejs.github.io/examples/)
* If you get bored or stuck, and a ton of effects!

### **Bonus**

Create a synth using any of the library's built-in synthesizers and map keys on your keyboard to play notes, like a piano. A can be C3, S can be D3 and so forth.
