# ðŸ•¹ Tonal Theremin

It's difficult playing a mouse controlled Theremin, don't you think? Let's introduce some tonality to make it more pleasant.

Instead of setting the `osc.frequency.value` relative to the mouse cursor, we want to use an array of frequencies. Here are some that sound nice together:

```javascript
const frequencies = [262, 330, 398, 494, 526];
```

The task now is to somehow map the mouse's `y` position to these frequencies so that a certain mouse position plays a certain frequency. You can make it go up and down the notes as you drag the mouse up and down the window, or you can come up with something else, it's up to you.

Your task is map the mouse `y` position to these frequencies so that a certain mouse position plays a certain frequency. You can make it go up and down the notes as you drag the mouse up and down the window, or you can come up with something else, it's up to you.

Use the [map\(\)](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/map) function or write your own logic.

### Bonus

Create a **second oscillator** that has a different implementation of how the mouse position is mapped to a frequency.

 For this oscillator, you can multiply the frequency by `2` to go an octave up!
