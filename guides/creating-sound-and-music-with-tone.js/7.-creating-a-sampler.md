# 7. Creating a sampler

To evolve our little installation we're going to add in new sounds. There are – as always in programming – several ways to do this. You could create a variable for each `Tone.Player` instance, or map them in a key-value object. You could also use `Tone.Sampler`, although its feature set is a little beyond what we need at the moment.

We will utilise the pluralised version of `Tone.Player`, namely [`Tone.Players`](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/13.8.25/Players). It works just like the singular one, but accepts an array of URLs. Apart from that the API is pretty much the same, giving us a single `.loaded` property to use just like in the previous example.

Here's how it looks:

```javascript
const urls = [
  'https://www.alexanderwallin.com/audio/pad-1.ogg',
  'https://www.alexanderwallin.com/audio/percussion-kick.ogg',
  'https://www.alexanderwallin.com/audio/synth-moog_bass.ogg',
]
const players = new Tone.Players(urls)
```

To then play a certain sound you use the `.get()` method:

```javascript
// Let's play the kick sound at index 1
players.get(1).restart()
```

### Playing the sampler

We now have a basic sampler. Let's make it playable! We're going to map the A, S and D keys to the different samples.

```javascript
const urls = [
  'https://www.alexanderwallin.com/audio/pad-2.ogg',
  'https://www.alexanderwallin.com/audio/percussion-kick.ogg',
  'https://www.alexanderwallin.com/audio/synth-moog_bass.ogg',
]
let players

function setup() {
  createCanvas(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight)
  Tone.Master.volume.value = -24
  
  players = new Tone.Players(urls)
  players.connect(Tone.Master)
}

function keyPressed() {
  if (!players.loaded) {
    return
  }
    
  let sampleIndex
  
  // Kick on A
  if (keyCode === 65) {
    sampleIndex = 1
  }
  // Bass on S
  else if (keyCode === 83) {
    sampleIndex = 2
  }
  // Pad on D
  else if (keyCode === 68) {
    sampleIndex = 0
  }
  
  if (sampleIndex >= 0) {
    players.get(sampleIndex).restart()
  }
}
```

We have started to build a little music machine! It's time look at some basic visuals.
