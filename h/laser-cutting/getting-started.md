# Getting started

Laser cutting comes down to two properties: Speed \(expressed in mm/s\) and Power \(what % of laser power\).  

{% hint style="info" %}
Speed is also written as a minimum and a maximum number. To start, make both of these numbers the same, but if you are looking for cleaner parts, try playing with a lower minimum number.
{% endhint %}

There are two ways to make the laser move: cutting and scanning. Cutting is easy, the laser moves along the vector path you have drawn at the speed and power you have set. Scanning runs the laser inside the entire area of a closed vector at the speed and power you have set.

Cutting is **much faster** than scanning.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Using the machine without proper knowledge is prohibited.

1. Do not leave machine unattended when it is working \(stay close and have a look at regular intervals\).
2. Do not cut materials you do not know.
3. Do not stare at a running laser beam. It is bad for your eyes.
4. You should only be cutting materials with no coatings; no paint, lacquer or glue. If you have any doubts about the material you are trying to laser, donâ€™t do it.
5. Do not laser vinyl records, that releases toxic gas.
6. Check lens and mirrors regularly
7. Check level of coolant and cooler temperature regularly
8. Do not run machine at 100% for prolonged times \(&gt;1 minute\)
9. Clean up after you use the machine If there is something not working properly, make note of it and let others know so it can be fixed.
10. Material not marked is up for grabs, just check that you know what you are cutting.
11. Replenish materials if you are able to do so.

## Prepare your file

### Kerf

Laser cutters have a kerf, meaning that all of your cuts will burn away a certain amount of material, making your cut pieces slightly smaller than designed. Once this number is calculated, you can compensate for it by offsetting your designs. The kerf is most important when you are making parts that press together and hold without glue

### Stroke

### Fill

### Color

* Red = Cutting
* Blue = Vector engraving
* Black = Raster engraving

### Export

DXF  \(Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format\) is a [CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design) data [file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format) which can be exported from several vector softwares, such as Illustrator and Inkscape. Use this when possible! Second option is he SVG format.
