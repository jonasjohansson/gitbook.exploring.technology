# Collaboration

Working in teams remote is a fun and exciting challenge. There are several tools available, and it is encouraged to think of digital tools as something that changes. The sooner this fact is accepted, the easier it will be to think freely and make the right choice for the moment.

Both Slack and Discord \([comparison](https://www.chanty.com/blog/discord-vs-slack/)\) are well worth checking out. Slack is the standard  tool for several studios since it has great support for other apps, while Discord has a large following amongst gamers and younger audiences. Mattermost \([comparison](https://mattermost.com/mattermost-vs-slack/)\) is similar to Slack but self-hosted, with attention to customisation and security.
