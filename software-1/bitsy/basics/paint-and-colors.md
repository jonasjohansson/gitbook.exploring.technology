# Paint & Colors

The paint window, our canvas, is where avatars, sprites, tiles and items are drawn. Click any pixel in the avatar, and it will disappear. Click it again and it will come back!

If you expand the **animation** option at the bottom of the drawing window, you can add a second frame! The other tabs in the paint window \(tile, sprite, and item\) work in the  same way. You will see the pixels from the previous frame dimmed down.

Look at the **colors** window. Picking the colors for a project can be one of the most important parts! It sets the mood and ambiance of the space. You get three colors; **Background**, **tile** and **sprite**. You can also have multiple palettes, for different rooms.

The default colors are: **\#0052cc** \(background\), **\#809fff** \(tile\) and  **\#ffffff** \(sprite\).
