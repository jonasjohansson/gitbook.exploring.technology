### Machine learning

An introduction to a range of simple-to-use machine learning techniques that allow people to use \(mainly\) camera inputs to control outputs. Techniques such as:

1. Training classification and regression models, and using these as outputs.
2. Track bodies and body parts with webcams.
3.  Track faces, and perform age, gender and expression estimations.
