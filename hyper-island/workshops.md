### Resonance Space

After an introduction on new and alternative game mechanics, holistic game design and the use of space for storytelling, the participants will design their own games in a playful design sprint. The main game assets will be themselves as well as nearby physical resources.

**Half the members of each team will join this workshop. You decide which half.**

### Physical nonlinear prototyping

In this workshop we will challenge our creativity and explore physical prototyping by creating a nonlinear storyboard matrix. We will use body storming as a way to test and validate our concepts. We will take action away from the chair and the desk and work with the body as a source of inspiration.

**Half the members of each team will join this workshop. You decide which half.**

### [A-Frame AR/VR](../software/a-frame/)

Browser based world building and mixed reality. With A-Frame and [Glitch](../tools/glitch.md) participants learn the basics of web powered graphics development while hacking their environment using augmented reality. 

→ [Create an account on Glitch](https://start.exploring.technology/tools/glitch)!

### [Generative design](../software/p5/)

Through [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) participants scratch the surface of artificial intelligence as they learn about generative design, and how machines can help make art, music and experiences! 

→ [Creat](https://editor.p5js.org/)[e an account on P5js](https://editor.p5js.org/)!

### Laser Basics

Introduction to the laser cutter where participants will learn about the fantastic world of rapid fabrication and laser. while going from digital illustrations to physical reproductions!

### Laser Advanced

Besides becoming the class laser super star, participants will get to explore some of the finer techniques of laser cutting as they build their own dexterity games.

### \*\*\*\*[**Arduino Basics**](../hardware/arduino/)\*\*\*\*

Build interactive objects using the worlds most famous micro-controller, the Arduino Uno! This three-hour workshop get participants learning the basics of electronics, buttons, potentiometers, sensors and how to make annoying sounds. 

→  [Install Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) and bring a USB adapter if your computer lacks normal USB ports.

### \*\*\*\*[**Arduino Advanced**](../hardware/arduino/) **A**

Build your own mini-game as you explore the sensory equipment for proximity, motion, light and force. This is an advanced session that assumes a basic understanding of Arduino, and digs deeper into combining code from different places in order to create something new!

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Requires Arduino Basic**
{% endhint %}

### [**Arduino Advanced**](../hardware/arduino/) **B**

Hack the controls of existing games and game like experiences by building your own touch based interface! In this workshop participants will choose a game, and re-imagine how it's played  and experienced, for instance creating a "scary" Tetris or a "goofy" Resident Evil.

**Requires Arduino Basic**

### [Bitsy game development](../software/bitsy/)

A crash course in rules of play, ergodic literature and [Bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy), a game creation tool focused on the poetry of game design, encouraging thought, reflection and decision making. Welcome to getting stuck on all the right details!

### [Machine Learning](../software/machine-learning.md)

An introduction to a range of simple-to-use machine learning techniques that allow people to use \(mainly\) camera inputs to control outputs.
