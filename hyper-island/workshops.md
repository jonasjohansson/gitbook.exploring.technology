### Bodystorming

Do, or do not, there is no try.

### TBD

### Laser Basics

Introduction to the laser cutter where participants will co-create skill badges and their team symbols. 

**Required for joining Laser Advanced.**

### Laser Advanced

Something something dark side.

### A-Frame AR/VR

Browser based world building and mixed reality. With A-Frame and Glitch participants learn the basics of web powered graphics development while hacking their environment using augmented reality.

### Arduino Basics

Build interactive objects using the worlds most famous micro-controller, the Arduino Uno! This three-hour workshop get participants learning the basics of electronics, buttons, potentiometers, sensors and how to make annoying sounds. 

**Required for joining Arduino Advanced.**

### Arduino Advanced

Further exploration into the world of sensory equipment. 

**Required for joining Arduino Special.**

### Arduino Special

Build absurd and ludic custom music interfaces! This specialised workshop makes use of all things previously learnt, and combines it with our own senses.

### Generative design

Through p5.js participants learn about generative art while making their own!

### Machine learning

An introduction to a range of simple-to-use machine learning techniques that allow people to use \(mainly\) camera inputs to control outputs. Techniques such as:

1. Training classification and regression models, and using these as outputs.
2. Track bodies and body parts with webcams.
3.  Track faces, and perform age, gender and expression estimations.
