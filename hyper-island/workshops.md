### Functions of Fun and Space

After an introduction on new and alternative game mechanics, holistic game design and the use of space for storytelling, the participants will design their own games in a playful design sprint. The main game assets will be themselves as well as nearby physical resources.

### Physical nonlinear prototyping

In this workshop we will challenge our creativity and explore physical prototyping by creating a nonlinear storyboard matrix. We will use body storming as a way to test and validate our concepts. We will take action away from the chair and the desk and work with the body as a source of inspiration.

### [A-Frame AR/VR](../software/a-frame/)

Browser based world building and mixed reality. With A-Frame and [Glitch](../software/glitch.md) participants learn the basics of web powered graphics development while hacking their environment using augmented reality. 

_🙋🏻‍♂️10 spots open for Motion Creative and Content Developer_

### [Generative design](../software/p5/)

Through [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) participants learn about generative art while making their own!

### \*\*\*\*[**Arduino Basic**](../hardware/arduino/)\*\*\*\*

Build interactive objects using the worlds most famous micro-controller, the Arduino Uno! This three-hour workshop get participants learning the basics of electronics, buttons, potentiometers, sensors and how to make annoying sounds. 

→  [Install Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) and bring a USB adapter if your computer lacks normal USB ports.

### \*\*\*\*[**Arduino Advanced**](../hardware/arduino/)\*\*\*\*

Further exploration into the world of sensory equipment.

### **Arduino Special**

Hack the controls of existing games and game like experiences by building your own! In this workshop participants will choose a game, and re-imagine how it's played  and experienced, for instance creating a "scary" Tetris or a "goofy" Resident Evil.

### Machine Learning

An introduction to a range of simple-to-use machine learning techniques that allow people to use \(mainly\) camera inputs to control outputs.

### [Bitsy game development](../software/bitsy.md)

A crash course in rules of play, ergodic literature and [Bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy), a game creation tool focused on the poetry of game design, encouraging thought, reflection and decision making. Welcome to getting stuck on all the right details!
