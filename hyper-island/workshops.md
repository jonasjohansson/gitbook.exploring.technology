### Bodystorming

### Mega games

### [Mixed reality](../software/a-frame/)

Browser based world building and mixed reality. With A-Frame and [Glitch](../software/glitch.md) participants learn the basics of web powered graphics development while hacking their environment using augmented reality. 

### [Generative design](../software/p5/)

Through [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) participants learn about generative art while making their own! ****

**Preparations:** [Creating an account](https://editor.p5js.org/).

### Laser Basics

Introduction to the laser cutter where participants will co-create skill badges and their team symbols.

### Laser Advanced

### \*\*\*\*[**Arduino Basic**](../hardware/arduino/)\*\*\*\*

Build interactive objects using the worlds most famous micro-controller, the Arduino Uno! This three-hour workshop get participants learning the basics of electronics, buttons, potentiometers, sensors and how to make annoying sounds. 

Come prepared by [installing Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software), and a USB adapter if your computer lacks normal USB ports.

### \*\*\*\*[**Arduino Advanced**](../hardware/arduino/)\*\*\*\*

Further exploration into the world of sensory equipment.

### **Arduino Special**

Hack the controls of existing games and game like experiences by building your own! In this workshop participants will choose a game, and re-imagine how it's played  and experienced, for instance creating a "scary" Tetris or a "goofy" Resident Evil.

### Machine Learning

An introduction to a range of simple-to-use machine learning techniques that allow people to use \(mainly\) camera inputs to control outputs.

### [Bitsy game development](../software/bitsy.md)

A crash course in rules of play, ergodic literature and [Bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy), a game creation tool focused on the poetry of game design, encouraging thought, reflection and decision making. Welcome to getting stuck on all the right details!

## Preparations

For all workshops, bring your computer and charger.
