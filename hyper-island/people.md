### Ana Shcherbakova

An elfish \(kinda\) human being. I came a long way from linguistics to web development and now my mind is set on design. I speak four languages, but when learning them wasn’t enough I turned to programming languages \(technology is the future, y’all\). Now I am trying to use my passion for design and programming skills to become the best developer/designer I can be!
