# Hyper Island

A multi-faceted project of play, narrative and technology is what 100 students at Hyper Island will experience as they press start. The four-week project Exploring Technology will encourage the creation of transformative experiences and offer a plethora of workshops, ranging from laser cutting to machine learning, allowing the teams to strategically gain the knowledge they require.

In order to further facilitate learning and reflection, a mid delivery in the shape of a three-day sprint project will train students in the art of making choices and delivering a solid experience and presentation. All training wheels are then removed as the teams work towards the final project, an exhibition encouraging participation, imagination, activation and transformation.

### Asking questions

In order to facilitate situations where neither Internet nor the self is able to find the way forward, there is the shared forum! Use it to share your questions, and potentially answer others. The Industry Leaders will often answer well formed questions with equally qualitative answers.

### Sharing progress

Documentation is important! We will encourage all teams to share their current progress on Instagram, and it's also what we will use for workshop deliverables. Get used to sharing your work, without the risk \(or chance\) of anyone knowing it is you!

→ [Post on \(y\)our Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/exploring_technology/)!

### Attending workshops

Define your teams attributes by attending the workshops you feel are relevant to you. Put all your points into an attribute and specialise, or find balance by having a generalist approach. Each member in your team must use the [Workshop Character Signup Sheet](https://forms.gle/MuMrCgQEwZ9kEjWX8) when required.
