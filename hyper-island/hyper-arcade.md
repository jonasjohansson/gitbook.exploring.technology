# ðŸ¥‡ Hyper Arcade

Shaking the habitual, a call for action to break our comforts, express **our** **selves** and think and act differently in order to become beacons of radical change. Technology is not the promised saviour; humanity is, and that which makes us unique, our imagination. 

> The answer that came to me again and again was play. Every human society in recorded history has games. We don't just solve problems out of necessity. We do it for fun. Even as adults. Leave a human being alone with a knotted rope and they will unravel it. Leave a human being alone with blocks, and they will build something. Games are part of what makes us human. We see the world as a mystery, a puzzle, because we've always been a species of problem-solvers. â€” Alexandra Drennan, The Talos Principle.

For the final project, each team will create playable interactive art installations and story-driven experiences in unconventional ways. We challenge the students to re-think what a game is, understand its structure of rules, choices and consequences and use it in their favour. It can be technologically intricate or blunt, meta or dada, gazing inwards or outwards, but must still maintain game-like qualities. The point is to find the [circle of play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_circle_%28virtual_worlds%29), the moment when the player is in full acceptance of their situation,  and reflect upon what it seed they wish to plant anew or provide nurture too.

> The arena, the card-table, the magic circle, the temple, the stage, the screen, the tennis court, the court of justice, etc are all in form and function play-grounds ie forbidden sports, isolated, hedged round, hallowed, with which special rules obtain. All are temporary worlds within the ordinary world, dedicated to the performance of an act apart.

Together, we will create the **Hyper Arcade**, a playground of ideas and experiences, and an exhibition encouraging participation, imagination, activation and transformation!

### Deliverable

Each team will create 1 playable game-like experience, which may or may not use Arduino. The game can be an extension of the Bitsy challenge, but this is not required. It can use tools presented in the workshops, but may also be made in other ways. This project is about using your skills as designers to immerse participants into **your world**. Technology has many faces, and we want you to make choices based on the experience you want to get across. Feel free to consider the way you are dressed, how players are invited, the space which the experience exists in. **Become the experience.**

In order to promote the game, each team will also create a [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSYA9R70R8) and a website \(could also be an [Itch.io](https://itch.io/) page\) with information about the game. Traditionally, game developers continuously release updates, create teasers and trailers, until the final launch.

**The game, trailer and website will be presented at the internal presentation for final critique, a few days before the official exhibition. Design and game experts will be present, and awards given.**
