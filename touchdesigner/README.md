An amazing software which allows you to do "visual coding", meaning you'll learn how to program interactivity and real-time visuals by connecting blocks together called operators. 

TD is used for many different things, some of its main uses are real-time 2D/3D visuals, often used for cultural events, brands and retail experiences, VJ'ing, interactive installations, prototyping, data-visualization, simulations, media and content handling, as well as AR/VR. 

TouchDesigner is free to use and offers various licences, including a reduced one for students which will lift the 1280x1280 resolution limit \(none of the exercises will need this\). Head over to [https://derivative.ca/download](https://derivative.ca/download) to install. 

TouchDesigner is a "node based programming environment", you'll find this way of programming in many more places, such as Notch, parts of Unity/Unreal, Houdini. VVVV and Cables.gl. Within TouchDesigner many things can be done as well using Python, and GLSL.
