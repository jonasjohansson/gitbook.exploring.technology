# Projectors

## **Guide to projectors**

Video projectors are for sure one of the most important tools for creators of interactive installations and artists. 

In this guide I will focus on the  projector as hardware, technical concepts and terminology.

## What is a Projector ?

Projectors are an amazing piece of equipment, that can help us to create amazing art and interactive installations, also using a projector and projection we can play with the perception of reality using light and shadows, but technically a projector is just a complex flashlight that shoots a square shaped image  ****:\)

## Planning

As a good practice you should always plan ahead and make a checklist before choose a projector for interactive installation or larger projection. Here is a sample of a checklist.

* What are you projecting on? 
* Size of the projection?
* Scrim material?
* Flat surface or complex geometry?
* Architectural projection?
* What is the environment like?
* indoor or outdoor?
* Color of the surface?
* Front or rear projection? 
* Portrait mode projection?
* Floor projection?
* Permanent projection? How many hours the projector will be ON?
* Network control?
* How much ambient light is there? Is it a bright show room, or a dim purpose-lit space? Is there lighting design?
* How to mount the projector?
* How will you run the cables from the projector to the computer? How many meters of cables will you need?
* Where is the projection Sweet Spot?
* Is there a potential people casting shadows?

**Visiting the installation venue/space is optimal when starting to plan your installation. This will get you the best sense of space, positioning options and sense of ambient light.  Another important thing is to ask for the CAD drawings of the space.  So now it is up to you if you want to make a 3D render of the placement or even making a scale mode.**

##  Projector Technology

I will go briefly through the different type of technologies.

Most of the times we will choose the projector that is available to us and within the budget, and probably we don’t pay so much attention to type of technology the projector has, but in my experience knowing your projector can make a huge difference in your project.

* DLP
* LCD
* LASER ⚡️

## DLP

DLP stands for “_Digital Light Processing_.”This is one of the most commonly used projector types. One of the key features of a  DLP technology is that it can display much darker blacks than LCD technology which is especially helpful for illusions like projection mapping. 

Within DLP projectors you can find two types, Single chip and 3-Chip. In single chip DLP,  a light source is passed through a rapidly spinning multi-segment color wheel of 3 or more dichroic glass sections \(7 or more color segments is a more "desirable" spec than 3\). That light then bounces off a matrix of electrically controlled microscopic mirrors that determine the brightness of each individual pixel. The beam then passes through filters and out through a lens. The timing between the color wheel and the movement of the mirrors determines the color of the output.

Standard DLP projectors use 3-segment color wheels. 4-part color wheels add a white segment \(to increase brightness\). 6-segment color wheels deliver a wider color range. [6x Speed RGBRGB Color Wheel projectors](https://www.viewsonic.com/us/px725hd.html) boost red, blue, and green hue and saturation. The result: vivid images with smoother color gradients.

Here is more information about it: [https://forums.afterdawn.com/threads/the-3-types-of-projector-explained-lcd-dlp-crt.291323/](https://forums.afterdawn.com/threads/the-3-types-of-projector-explained-lcd-dlp-crt.291323/)

## LCD

There are a couple different LCD technologies for projection, but 3LCD is probably the most recommended in terms of image quality. With LCD projection, a light source is bounced through 3 dichroic filters that turn the white light into precise red/green/blue frequencies. Those differently colored beams of light then pass through liquid crystal arrays that turn on and off their pixels and block the different light patterns to form the image. Those LCD's are then recombined with a prism that recombines the 3 colored segments into a single light beam/image that then passes through a lens. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/3lcd_projector.png)

LCD projection doesn't have the rainbow banding effect that DLP does and tends to be easier to film, but it doesn't have the darkest blacks, so it doesn't disappear as much when the screen is just displaying a black image, and you can see more like a grayish color.

## Laser

What can I say about Laser projectors, well they are the " new thing" and they are super cool, and set to become the standard for projector technology.  According to Futuresource, the market for projectors in 2020 will be 74% laser based. It offers reliability, high brightness, and is set to offer significant advantages to a range of industries or applications including cinema, large venues, education and control room. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/laser.png)

#### Laser offer  new benefits and here is a few of them:

* Illumination source lifetimes of 20,000 hours or even more
* More brightness – up to 70,000 lumen
* Lower brightness decline during life time
* Better brightness uniformity
* Generally maintenance free, as no lamp replacement necessary
* Higher reliability
* Higher contrast
* Wider color gamut
* Lower energy consumption and lower thermal emission
* Instant on/off capability, flexible brightness adjustment \(20-100%\)
* Mercury free

There are numerous benefits with a laser light source, but the bottom line is that they more closely address the needs of the market and laser is being adopted in growing numbers. 

The qualitative brightness superiority and potential for energy savings combined with the significant reduction of maintenance cost makes it likely that laser will eventually replace lamp-based projection systems as the primary projection light source.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**There is a myth out there about Laser projectors can only be installed by specialists. This might have been true previously, as laser regulation meant that the installation process had to be conducted by a trained professional. Now, however, the installation of laser projectors has been made easier, as classification changes mean that specially trained laser officers are not required – previously this would have added complexity to the installation. Now, there are recommendations for health and safety but is it no longer in the realm of laser regulation. For early adopters of laser, this transforms the installation process, making it easier, more cost-effective and faster.**

## Projector Type

Each project might need a different type of projector, maybe you are doing a projection in dark and control room in an art gallery or an interactive projection and you can’t have the shadows of the audience, or could be a massive projection and you need 20 large venue projectors. 

When you are planning your project is very important to understand what type of projector you need and why.



#### Pico Projectors

I’m not going to talk so much about this one, because probably you will not find so many situation where you need this type of projector.  Normally the **Brightness range :** 20 lumens to 1000 lumens, and a **Resolution range :** 640 x 360 to 1280 x 800

Some pico projectors can be powered with batteries, and just few has infinite depth of field and require no focusing, so you can project on very close up things clearly.

But if you want to get inspired with what you can do with a pico projector and be creative here is a nice example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwL3PEeE0sU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwL3PEeE0sU)

#### \*\*\*\*

#### **Portable Projector**

This type probably you are very familiar with, they are very common in classrooms and small office space. Normally they only have a single lamp, not so bright and the mechanical parts inside are not so stable, so don’t crazy with this type of projector.

**Brightness range:** 1000 lumens to 3000 lumens **Resolution :** 1024x768 to 1080 p

![](../.gitbook/assets/portable_projector.png)

For sure you can use these ones in an installation, but be aware they aren't designed for that, most of the times can be very difficult to setting them up in an installation. Some projectors just don't handle 24/7 operation very well, so keep this in mind. 

With portable projectors you will encounter multiple limitations: 

* Limited options for throw ratio 
* Image sizes
*  Brightness range
* Very limited zoom adjustments
* No lens shift

If you want to use this type in an outdoor installation just take in consideration that it has to be pitch black and not so big screen size.

#### Installation Projectors

So probably over 85% of your projects will be **OK** using this type of projector, and media artists loves these ones.

**Price Range:** $2200 - $13,000 **Brightness range**: 3000-10000 lumens **Resolution range**: 1280x720 to 1920 x1200

![](../.gitbook/assets/installationprojector.png)

It's hard to cover  as there are a wide range of brands, lenses, and imaging elements. 

They will cover you in most indoor installations if you're trying to cover a reasonable amount of space \(ambient light and windows permitting\). These ones tend to be heavier and larger \(6 kg+\) but offer more configuration options than the portable class \(control over LAN and HDBaseT\). They are also designed for 24/7 operation so they are more acceptable to use for long term installations. Some models also support portrait mode projection and 360º rotation. Maintenance and support is generally easier with these as well, but at an obvious jump in price.

![Viewsonic LS700HD: good projector for permanent installation and the price is under 2000$](../.gitbook/assets/09-360-degree.jpg)

These projectors also start to bring in multiple lens options for short throw 0.4 to long throw 4.0 ratio with the same body. They also offer more options for lens zoom and lens shift which are super handy.

If you're trying to get more than a 6 meters wide image or are dealing with stage lighting,  you will need to do some brightness and size calculation before you commit to these ones, but we will talk about that later. 

If you are planning to have an installation longer than a week probably will make more sense if you buy one one of these instead of renting, it quickly becomes more cost effective to just purchase one of these classes of projectors \(or the portables\) because you would be paying the same amount in a week or so anyway.
