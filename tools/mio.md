# Mio

Mio  is a minimal input and output application that enables serial communication to computer interaction. All logic is handled on sending device and made possible by printing specific messages.

void setup() {

    // send 'red' and a random value between 0-255 over sockets
    Serial.println("red" + String(red));

MIDI commands are sent by default with the control value being the index of the key referencing the key lookup table, found in Preferences.

| Message | Event |  | Version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $down | Click 'down' key | [List of keys](https://robotjs.io/docs/syntax#keys) | 1.0.0 |
| $mouse | Click left mouse button |  | 1.1.3 |
| 100,200 | Move cursor to x 100 and y 200 | Must be comma separated | 1.1.3 |
| red255 | Send 'red' and the value '255' over sockets | Can be any name and number | 1.1.1 |

Make sure to run the latest version of Mio to make use of all the new functions. Latest stable release prior to advanced features is **1.0.10**.

## Websockets

Mio creates a local websocket server with the default port **8080**. This means that generative graphics, for instance, can be manipulated by a button or potentiometer. Clients must be initialised **after** the server has started.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="P5" %}
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://127.0.0.1:8080");

let red = 0;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(red, 0, 0);
}

ws.onmessage = data => {
  let d = JSON.parse(data.data);
  print(d);
  if (d.id === "red") {
    red = d.msg;
  }
};
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="HTML" %}
```markup
<html>
  <body>
    <script>
      const ws = new WebSocket("ws://127.0.0.1:8080");
      ws.onmessage = data => {
        let d = JSON.parse(data.data);
        console.log(d);
        if (d.id === "red") {
          document.documentElement.style.backgroundColor = `rgb(${d.msg},0,0)`;
        }
      };
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

It is possible to connect to the local websocket server from machines outside of the network using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs). Forward the correct port and on the receiving end use the newly generated address. Another alternative is setting up a [server](https://glitch.com/~mio-server) and [client](https://glitch.com/~mio-client) on Glitch.

{% hint style="success" %}
It's a bit secret but it is also possible to send key commands to Mio via websockets. Try typing `ws.send("$x")` and it will behave just like printing it from Arduino. Magic! üßùüèΩ

## Troubleshooting

### Unidentified Developer

Because Mio is made by an [Unidentified Developer](https://jonasjohansson.se/) the Control key must be pressed while clicking the app icon. Then choose **Open** from the menu.

### Permission

In order to control the keyboard, Mio requires permissions. On Mac, go to System preferences &gt; Security & Privacy, unlock the page by clicking the lock and providing the password, and then under Accessibility find Mio and tick the box. **If a new version has been installed, this might have to be done again by toggling the checkbox!**

### Resource Busy

Mio can not be connected at the same time that any other device is listening to the serial communication, such as **Arduino's Monitor or Plotter**. The same is true for the other way around.

### Faster communication

It is possible to speed up the communication between the serial device and computer, by bumping up the **Baudrate** from **9600** to **115200**. This must be done within the code as well as in Mio. If you are running Arduino, remember to change it also in the monitor \(in the bottom right corner\).

![](../.gitbook/assets/serial.png)

### No Communication

It is possible that Mio caches files which are then still remnant when using a new version. To clear the cache go to Help &gt; Reset and then Help &gt; Reload. If it still does not work, [contact the developer](https://jonasjohansson.se/) and send a screenshot of the window that appears when clicking Help &gt; Open Developer Tools Detached.
