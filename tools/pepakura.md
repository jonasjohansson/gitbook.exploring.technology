# Pepakura

Ever heard of paper craft?  It's the art of creating one, two or three-dimensional objects in paper. Pepakura Designer is a great and popular program for making real world papercraft models from 3D digital models. Expand all the measurements to create large scale sculptures, and light them up with projection mapping for radical paper brightness!

For large projects make sure to use Foam Board \(Kapaskiva\), at either [3mm](https://www.svexo.se/kapaskiva-3mm-70x100cm-25fp) or [5mm](https://www.svexo.se/kapaskiva-5mm-100x140cm-25fp) \(preferred\) thickness.  Use fishing wire to cross-stitch several boards together. Cut the boards with a sharp mat cutter or X-Acto knife.

### Install

Get Pepakura \([link](https://tamasoft.co.jp/pepakura-en/download/index.html)\) and if you are on Windows, proceed, and if on Mac install Wineskin Winery \([link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wineskin/)\).

Wineskin enables Linux and Mac \(and more\) users to run Windows applications without a copy of Microsoft Windows. There are several guides \([this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHpqP0FET0w) and [this](https://www.maketecheasier.com/pepakura-designer-mac/)\) out there which are great since the setup can be a bit awkward.

Open Wineskin Winery, click the **plus** symbol and add the latest. Also click **Update** and get the latest wrapper version. Once ready, click **Create New Blank Wrapper** and give the blank wrapper the name "Pepakura Designer". Give it some time, and when complete, click **View wrapper in Finder**. 

Open the newly created app \(if it says it can't be opened, try again\). Select **Install Software** and select the previously downloaded Pepakura Windows executable. It should be named _setup\_pepakura416\_en.exe_ or similar. Follow the instructions and agree to everything.

Ignore the error saying "Error: Invalid operation".
{% endhint %}

The software should now open!

Close Pepakura Designer and open it again. It will now request which executable it should use. Make sure to select _pepakura4.exe_ from the list.

Click **OK** and exit Wineskin by simply closing the window. Next time it is opened it should open the app directly.

_If you don't like the default app icon, download the official Pepakura icon below, then right-click the app and drag the icon to the thumbnail. Done!_

### Using Pepakura

Pepakura works with several formats but OBJ is recommended. This format can be easily exported from popular 3d tools. Click **File** and **Open** and choose your OBJ file. Below is an example.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/platonic.obj" %}

Once opened, click **Unfold** and follow the instructions. Then, simply export the output.
