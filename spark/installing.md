{% hint style="info" %}
TouchDesigner works on Mac and PC. Keep in mind that on Mac there are a few restrictions related to the graphics card. For us this doesn't matter at this point.
{% endhint %}

On your first time opening TouchDesigner you'll see a lot of things happening. First you'll be asked to log in with the account you've created on the Derivate website. After doing this you will be able to use one out of the five free licence keys that come with your account. Activate one and you'll be greeted with your first TouchDesigner project.

If you want to return to the Key manager, you can find it on the top left under **Dialogs** and then **Key Manager**.
