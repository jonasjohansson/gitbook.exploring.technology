# Cinema 4D

A staple in 3d, Cinema 4D \(C4D\) provides an "easy to learn, difficult to master" adaptive interface. For a fantastic, free and community driven alternative, have a look at [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

### Install

Try \([link](https://www.maxon.net/en-us/try/)\) C4D for 14 days, and, if a student or lecturer,  apply \([link](https://www.maxon.net/en/learn/educational-licenses/students-and-instructors/)\) for a license that will last 6 months \(can be renewed\).

### Renderers

Many of the work made in 3d use Octane \([demo](https://home.otoy.com/render/octane-render/demo/#demo), [rent](https://home.otoy.com/render/octane-render/subscriptions/#enterprise)\) or Redshift \([demo](https://www.redshift3d.com/demo), [buy](https://www.redshift3d.com/buy)\), renderers that help the designs reach their full potential.
