# Beepbox

Audio can be understood in many shapes, music, melody, sound effect or even complete silence. There are several great applications out there for getting started, such as [Ableton Live](http://ableton.com/) and [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/). To venture into more unknown territories, have a look at [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Welcome), where music happens through code.  [Beepbox](https://www.beepbox.co/) is a dead simple tool with several opportunities, and an inspiring helping hand into the world of audio production. It is essentially a sequencer with great possibilities, often lending itself to a retro video game type of sound.

### Install

### Setup

To get a better view of the interface, open **Preferences** and select **Full-Screen Layout** and **Show Piano Keys**. Change the scale to any of the "Normal" options under **Song Settings**. Scale defines the notes available, with **Easy** making only room for "harmony safe" notes.

### Sequencer

In the bottom there are **4 rows** and **16 columns.** Each row has a color, corresponding to an instrument. **Teal/Yellow/Red** can be set to any type of instrument, while **Grey** is used for percussion. Besides the color there is number containing a unique pattern. Each instrument can have ten different patterns 0-9.  All highlighted cells have patterns, with 0's are empty.

Click any of the cells and look at **Instrument Settings** to change the instrument.

{% hint style="success" %}
The purple selection defines the amount of columns to be included in the playback and export.
{% endhint %}

To play music, "draw" notes on the notes on the piano roll by click, drag and release on any selected cell. Click **Play** or hit **Space** to listen.

After writing a note it is possible to modify it, by clicking and dragging up or down: in this way you will obtain the so called **Glide Effect**. ****That means there will be no interruption between one note and the next one, and the pitch will slide between different values, instead of jumping. You can find this function in several synths, and can also be called **Portamento**.

Every row \(besides gray\) has a **different octave** with red being the lowest and teal the highest; meaning it is preferable to use red for bass lines and harmonies, while teal and yellow are ideal for melodies and arpeggios. As we said before, the bottom row \(grey\) can only contain percussive sounds.

### Save

After composig your tune, copy the link to safe your work! In this way, opening the link again, you'll be able to edit your song. 

When you are finished, you can export a .wav fine through the file menu: file &gt; export song. At this point you will see something like that:

Select "export to .wav file" to obtain an audio file, and choose the number of times you want your loop to be played by the sequencer. You will then find your file in the _download_ folder.

Let's understand some music theory to be guided during the writing process!
