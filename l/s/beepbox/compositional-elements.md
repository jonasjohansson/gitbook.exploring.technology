# Compositional elements

### Variations

Changing just one or two element of a melody, specially the first or the last note, can help to being able to use it several times BUT with a narrative strenght!  
Same thing happens with rhythm: changing, during time, few elements of a repetitive pattern can enforce it!

### Silence

Silence is part of the music, like small pauses are part of a conversation, never forget about it on a micro level \(melody\) and on a macro level \(structure\).

### Surprise!

An unattended event, moment, transition can be the key to create some attention.

### Structure

This loop is amazing! Oh wow is incredible! Wow is super nice! Ok, now is...boring. Develop your material to start from A, arrive at B passig through C, going back to A, visiting D \[don't forget about silence\], quickly through B and home again in A.
