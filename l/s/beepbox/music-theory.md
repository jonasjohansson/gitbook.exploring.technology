# Music introduction

### Introduction

If we think about music, probably everyone can picture something different in his mind: piano lessons, his records collection, a techno party, etc.   
Music is all of this, for sure, but if we need to find a common denominator to define it, we can choose these two words: **sound** and **vibration**. Every kind of vibration that can reach our ear produce a sound, and this can be consider music, specially when is organised into a composition.  
  
[Edgard Varèse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgard_Var%C3%A8se) \(1883 -1965\) described music as "organised sound", while [Luciano Berio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Berio) \(1925 - 2003\) as "everything that one listens to with the intention of listening to music".

These suggestions are here to let you think about music as something that is not just framed into theory, scores, genres, intruments. Everything related with our perception through our ears can be creatively used and transformed into music.

_But knowing some rule doesn't hurt so let's see how it works!_

### Intervals and scales

Physically speaking, three main parameters should be considered to describe sound: **duration** \(time\), **pitch** \(frequency\), **amplitude** \(intensity\).   


![Spectrogram of a synth note: duration on X axis, pitch on Y axis, amplitude  on a scale from blue to orange.](../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine%20%2810%29.png)

If we are able to control/set these parameters, like when we play an instrument \(both acoustic and electronic\) we are able to control the sound result that we will obtain. 

_Now we will focus on how we can deal with the pitch_.

To compose using notes, we should see the **pitch as a sequence of equal intervals.**

A _specific_ sequence of intervals generates a **scale.** In the following example the intervals needed to create a **major scale** are showed.

If notes are changed, defining a so called new **key**, but the interval sequence is mantained, we will still obtain a major scale, just with a different pitch.

If we now change the interval sequence, we will obtain a new type of scale. In the following example you will see a **minor scale**. Probably you will notice that the notes contained in this A minor scale are the same contained in the C major scale: this show us that using the **same notes** with a **different interval sequence** creates **different results.**

What we learned until now can already show us **how important is the relashionship between different notes.** If we write a short melody and we use different notes as a _pedal_ to create a context for them, the result will be really different: [melody with a C pedal](https://beepbox.co/#8n31s6k0l00e03t22m2a7g0fj07i0r1o3210T0v1L4u10q0d0f8y0z1C2w2c0h0T0v1L4u13q1d1f7y1z1C0w5c0h1T1v1L4uc7q1d4f6y1z1C0c0A6F1B2V1Q5209Pca84E0021T2v1L4u15q0d1f8y0z1C2w0b4h400000000h4g000000014h000000004h400000000p1oFHZwwpa2xp5dHW82CZ7-0000), [melody with a A pedal](https://beepbox.co/#8n31s6k0l00e03t22m2a7g0fj07i0r1o3210T0v1L4u10q0d0f8y0z1C2w2c0h0T0v1L4u13q1d1f7y1z1C0w5c0h1T1v1L4uc7q1d4f6y1z1C0c0A6F1B2V1Q5209Pca84E0021T2v1L4u15q0d1f8y0z1C2w0b4h400000000h4g000000014h000000004h400000000p1pFHZwwpa2xp5dHW82CZ7Qw0000).

### Chords and arpeggios

A chord is a set of **multiple notes played simultaneously**. We can create a chord from a given scale, starting from each step of the scale: we start from one note, we jump one, we take the next one, we jump one, and we take the next one. These three notes can either create a major chord or a minor chord, depending on the intervals that connect them.

If **chord's notes are played in a sequence** and not symultaneously we obtain an **arpeggio**.

### Duration: time

In music time is usually defined in **BPM**, that stands for **beat per minute.** This means that if we have 60 BPM we will have a beat every second, 120 BPM two beats every second, and so on. BPMs are setting the **speed** of our sounds.

Time is usually divided in bars, that are “boxes” for the chosen **time signature**: it sets **how many beats should be contained in one bar**.

If we choose a 4/4 time signature, one bar will contain four 1/4 notes:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine%20%286%29.png)

If we choose a 3/4 time signature, one bar will contain four 1/4 notes.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine%20%2820%29.png)

**The quarte note can be divided in sub divisions**, creating new time values. We should just be aware that the total amount of each bar should always be 4/4 \(if this is the chosen time signature\).

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine%20%2827%29.png)

Understanding time values:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine%20%289%29.png)

If a **dot** is added close to a note, it **adds the half of its value to the duration**.
