# Music introduction

### Introduction

If we think about music, probably everyone can picture something different in his mind: piano lessons, his records collection, a techno party, etc.   
Music is all of this, for sure, but if we need to find a common denominator to define it, we can choose these two words: **sound** and **vibration**. Every kind of vibration that can reach our ear produce a sound, and this can be consider music, specially when is organised into a composition.  
  
[Edgard Var√®se](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgard_Var%C3%A8se) \(1883 -1965\) described music as "organised sound", while [Luciano Berio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Berio) \(1925 - 2003\) as "everything that one listens to with the intention of listening to music".
