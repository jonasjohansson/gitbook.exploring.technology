# Music introduction

### Introduction

If we think about music, probably everyone can picture something different in his mind: piano lessons, his records collection, a techno party, etc.   
Music is all of this, for sure, but if we need to find a common denominator to define it, we can choose these two words: **sound** and **vibration**. Every kind of vibration that can reach our ear produce a sound, and this can be consider music, specially when is organised into a composition.  
  
[Edgard Var√®se](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgard_Var%C3%A8se) \(1883 -1965\) described music as "organised sound", while [Luciano Berio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Berio) \(1925 - 2003\) as "everything that one listens to with the intention of listening to music".

These suggestions are here to let you think about music not as something framed into theory, scores, genres, intruments.

### Intervals

Physically speaking, three main parameters can be considered to describe sound: **duration** \(time\), **pitch** \(frequency\), **amplitude** \(intensity\).

Now we will focus on how we can deal with the pitch.
