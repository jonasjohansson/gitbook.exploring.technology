# Music introduction

### Introduction

If we think about music, probably everyone can picture something different in his mind: piano lessons, his records collection, a techno party, etc.   
Music is all of this, for sure, but if we need to find a common denominator to define it, we can choose these two words: **sound** and **vibration**. Every kind of vibration that can reach our ear produce a sound, and this can be consider music, specially when is organised into a composition.  
  
[Edgard Var√®se](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgard_Var%C3%A8se) \(1883 -1965\) described music as "organised sound", while [Luciano Berio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Berio) \(1925 - 2003\) as "everything that one listens to with the intention of listening to music".  


Since the prehistory, people always tried to represent music, as the only way to preserve musical ideas and to let them travel around the world without being orally transmitted.  
Physically speaking, three main parameters can be considered to describe sound: **duration** \(time\), **pitch** \(frequency\), **amplitude** \(intensity\).  The intent of representing these parameters brought to the growth of musical notation: defining pitch and duration is for instance the easiest way transmit a melody to someone else  can be represented in different ways, for instance can be written on **sheet music** or analysed with a **spectrogram**. A spectrogram, showing the spectral content of a sound, gives accurate information about the timbre.

## Notes and their relationships

Setting different relationships between notes will bring to really different results.  
In the following examples you can ear the same melody, juxtapose to different _pedal_ notes.
