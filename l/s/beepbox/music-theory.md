# Music introduction

### Introduction

If we think about music, probably everyone can picture something different in his mind: piano lessons, his records collection, a techno party, etc.   
Music is all of this, for sure, but if we need to find a common denominator to define it, we can choose these two words: **sound** and **vibration**. Every kind of vibration that can reach our ear produce a sound, and this can be consider music, specially when is organised into a composition.  
  
[Edgard Var√®se](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgard_Var%C3%A8se) \(1883 -1965\) described music as "organised sound", while [Luciano Berio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Berio) \(1925 - 2003\) as "everything that one listens to with the intention of listening to music".

These suggestions are here to let you think about music as something that is not just framed into theory, scores, genres, intruments. Everything related with our perception through our ears can be creatively used and transformed into music.

_But knowing some rule doesn't hurt so let's see how it works!_

### Intervals and scales

Physically speaking, three main parameters should be considered to describe sound: **duration** \(time\), **pitch** \(frequency\), **amplitude** \(intensity\).   


![Spectrogram of a synth note: duration on X axis, pitch on Y axis, amplitude  on a scale from blue to orange.](../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine%20%287%29.png)

If we are able to control/set these parameters, like when we play an instrument \(both acoustic and electronic\) we are able to control the sound result that we will obtain. 

_Now we will focus on how we can deal with the pitch_.

To compose using notes, we should see the **pitch as a sequence of equal intervals.**

A _specific_ sequence of intervals generates a **scale.** In the following example the intervals needed to create a **major scale** are showed.

If notes are changed, defining a so called new **key**, but the interval sequence is mantained, we will still obtain a major scale, just with a different pitch.
