### Layers & Columns

Each column can contain 1 output \(ex. video or image\) and each layer can contain multiple columns. Each layer can only have 1 colum

### Sources

Instead of video it's possible to code your own sources. Resolume offers a wide selection of pre-made sources such as Lines, Rings and more.

### Effects

The list of effects can be found in the bottom right. To add an effect, drag and drop it on the video clip, the layer or the composition tab.

Here's a list of the most useful effects:

#### Image adjustment

* Add Subtract
* Auto Mask
* Blur
* Bright.Contrast
* ChromaKey
* Colorize
* Crop
* Flip
* Hue rotate
* Keystone
* Levels
* Mirror
* Recolour
* Saturation
* Solid Color
* Stripper
* Threshold
* Tint
* Vignette

#### Visual FX

* Displace
* Distortion
* Goo
* Shift Glitch
* Trails
* Twisted
* Wave Warp

**Pro tip:** To avoid confusion add effects to the composition, and to the layer when absolutely necessary.

### Adding files

It is possible to "drag and drop" files directly to Resolume, but the suggested way is to use the File Browser in the bottom right. Navigate to the folder containing the relevant media.

A suggested structure for organisation is:

* MY\_VIDEO\_FOLDER
  * ORIGINAL
    * my\_source\_file.mp4
  * EDITED
    * my\_edited\_file-1.mp4
    * my\_edited\_file-2.mp4
    * my\_edited\_file-3.mp4
  * ENCODED
    * my\_encoded\_file-1.mov
    * my\_encoded\_file-2.mov
    * my\_encoded\_file-3.mov

**Pro tip:** If the file does not play change the extension to "mov" \(Quicktime\).
