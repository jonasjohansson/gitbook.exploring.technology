# Layers

Read from top to bottom, layers behave just like in other software as they are "stacked" on top of each other, and there's more:

* Each layer can be blocked \(**B**\) or turned solo \(**S**\), making it the only layer visible.
* The video \(**V**\) slider adjust the opacity of the layer, with the slider default in the middle 50% is let through, at 100% the layer is fully opaque, and at 0% it is completely transparent.
* The **Add** selection reveals several blending modes defining how the pixels of the layer will blend. Change the Solid Color blending mode to Multiply and see how the white lines become red.
* Use **X** to clear the active clip of the layer.
* If there are several clips in the layer, the transition time \(**T**\) will create a graphical transition between the two clips of the duration. The default effect is **Alpha**, meaning that the original clip will slowly fade out, while the new clip will fade in. There are several effects beside the default!
* The bar where it says **Layer 2** is the layer handle.
  * Click to select the layer.
  * Click and drag to change its order.
  * Right click for more settings, such as renaming the layer.
