# Clips

Traditional audiovisual performances involve video clips These clips can be made from any software that exports video and image sequences, or by editing filmed or found footage. In Resolume, clips can mean many things, and is essentially a "container" for a wide range of content. It is possible to create beautiful things without touching video editing, but it is often in the combination of the two that beautiful mysteries are unravelled.

_Have no video clips? Don't fret._ 

### Sources

Click **Sources** and drag a **Solid Color** and **Lines** to the top and second layer of the first column. These sources are **Generators**, packages of code written to create specific graphics. Click the clip thumbnail to activate it, or click the clip name just below, to see it in the **Preview Monitor**.

Besides the many generators, there are other sources available, such as the **Capture Devices** which enable connected web cameras and more. There is also NDI and Syphon, but that's for another day.

### Files

_If there are some video clips prepared, let's grab them._

Click **Files** and go through the folders. One the folder is found, the files within should appear as thumbnails. Drag these to the layers just like the sources.

Create a dedicated folder for your files and avoid having them in **Downloads**. Design the workflow with live performances in mind where lighting conditions are poor and it is crucial to find things fast.
