# Resolume

Resolume is an audiovisual performance tool and comes in two flavours: Avenue and Arena. Both enable you to play video and audio, and even use built-in generators for text and graphics. Arena also provides projection mapping possibilities!

### Install

Download [Resolume Arena](https://resolume.com/download/) and run the installation. This is the full package, but comes with watermarks on video and audio output unless a license is purchased.

{% hint style="success" %}
Mute the sound of the computer to avoid hearing the audio watermark!
{% endhint %}

### Running Arena

Upon starting the application an example composition is presented. It's a great starting point, but ultimately a distraction. Create a new, click **Composition** and **New**, or **⌘N**.

Before deciphering the interface, let's simplify it a bit. Click **View** and untick **Audio Controls**, **Crossfader, Dashboard, Help** and **Compositions**. Remember to save it by clicking **Layout** and **Save**, name it "Simple".

Ahhh, much better! Go to **Composition** and **Save**, or **⌘S**. A prompt will appear.

Name the composition and change the **Size** to **960x540**. The values should ideally reflect the final output ie. the resolution of the screen or projector where the visuals will be presented, but for learning it's better to go fast, and not have any lag.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Never have a larger composition size than what the projector or screen is set to output. This will only cause unnecessary strain on the computer.
{% endhint %}

Click **Save** and a new .avc file will be created in the Resolume folder, normally found under Documents.

{% hint style="info" %}
The .avc file can be shared with others, but the video files are not embedded, so make sure that if collaborating to also sync the media.
{% endhint %}

_That's it! Let's go!!_
