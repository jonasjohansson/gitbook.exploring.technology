# Resolume

Resolume is made for audiovisual performances and comes in two flavours: **Avenue** and **Arena**. Both enable you to play video and audio, and even use built-in generators for text and graphics. Arena also provides projection mapping possibilities, and is preferred route for learning.

### Install

Download [Resolume Arena](https://resolume.com/download/) and run the installation. This is the full package, but comes with watermarks on video and audio output unless a license is purchased. **Mute the sound** of the computer to avoid hearing the audio watermark.

### Running Arena

Upon starting the application an example composition is presented. It's a great starting point, but ultimately a distraction. To create a new, click **Composition** and **New**, or **⌘N**.

Before deciphering the interface, click **View** and untick **Audio Controls**, **Crossfader, Dashboard, Help** and **Compositions**. Save by clicking **Layout** and **Save.** Name it "Simple".

Here is the simple layout along with an advanced version.

{% file src="../../../.gitbook/assets/simple.xml" %}

{% file src="../../../.gitbook/assets/advanced.xml" %}

_The interface should now be easier to navigate!_

 To save this composition, go to **Composition** and **Save**, or **⌘S**. A prompt will appear.

Name the composition and change the **Size** to **960x540**. The values should ideally reflect the final output resolution \(most likely from a projector\), but for learning and experimenting it is less taxing on the computer to run at lower values.

Click **Save** and a new AVC file will be created in the Resolume folder, found under Documents. This file can be shared with others, but the video files are not embedded, so make sure that if collaborating to also sync the media.
