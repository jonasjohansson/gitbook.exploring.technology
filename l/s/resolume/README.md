# Resolume

Resolume is made for audiovisual performances and is served in two flavours: **Avenue** and **Arena**. Both enable you to play video and audio, and use built-in generators for text and graphics, but Arena also provides projection mapping possibilities!

### Install

Download [Resolume Arena](https://resolume.com/download/) and run the installation. This is the full package, but comes with watermarks on video and audio output unless a license is purchased. **Mute the sound** of the computer to avoid hearing the audio watermark.

### Community

Getting started as a performer can be real tough, and sometimes it makes a lot of sense to create a collective, a group of artists, that can help each other land those early gigs. When in doubt, reach out to any of the members of [NAVA](https://nava.community/), and join the [Swedish VJ Union](https://www.facebook.com/groups/swedishvjunion/). In both places there are individuals passionate about audiovisual art and culture.

There are few places that teach audiovisual art and technology, but they do exist. Check out [Audiovisuell produktion](https://www.du.se/sv/Utbildning/Program/audiovisuell-produktion---kandidatprogram/) \(AVP\) at Högskolan Dalarna, or [Audiovisual Art](https://www.engelsholm.dk/en/audiovisual-art-and-vjing) at Engelsholm Højskole. Students from AVP can be found here and there, for instance in collectives [Gruvfrun](https://gruvfrun.se/) and [Svärmorstunga](https://www.facebook.com/svarmorstungor/). One of the most active Stockholm artists is [Lillusion](https://lillusion.squarespace.com/)!
