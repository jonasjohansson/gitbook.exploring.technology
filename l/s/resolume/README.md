# Resolume

Resolume is made for audiovisual performances and comes in two flavours: **Avenue** and **Arena**. Both enable you to play video and audio, and even use built-in generators for text and graphics. Arena also provides projection mapping possibilities, and is preferred route for learning.

### Install

Download [Resolume Arena](https://resolume.com/download/) and run the installation. This is the full package, but comes with watermarks on video and audio output unless a license is purchased. **Mute the sound** of the computer to avoid hearing the audio watermark.
