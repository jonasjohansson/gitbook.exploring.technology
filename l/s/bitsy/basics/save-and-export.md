# Save & Export

To export your game so others can play it, go to the **download** window under **tools**. This will export your game as an HTML file. You can upload this to a website or open it directly in the browser.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can also load a Bitsy game from a previously exported HTML file!

Your game is saved within the browser. If you clear your browser cache, the game is lost. Always download the game data to be sure progress is maintained. To do this open the **game data** window and choose **download data**.
