# Bitsy

> Bitsy is a little editor for little games or worlds. the goal is to make it easy to make games where you can walk around and talk to people and be somewhere. — Adam Le Doux, creator of Bitsy

Games made in Bitsy range wildly in their size, scope, and genre, but it works especially well for short narrative games, little vignettes, or games about being in one place and wandering around. 

Bitsy is defined by its constraints. It has limited interaction, only three colors, and very little programming. The pixel canvas is tiny. However, this simplicity is incredibly useful for making focused and deliberate ideas. It gives every choice a lot of weight. Because it is so simple, it is also a great tool for prototyping ideas, or getting something down on paper right away.

Besides Bitsy there are several other minimal game design tools and languages around that can be of interest.

## The Spriters Resource

It is fortunate designing pixel games, as so much has already been made, so there's lots of great inspiration out there. [The Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/) rips the sprite sheets from games, so that others may understand better the graphic design within classic games like Final Fantasy or Super Mario.
