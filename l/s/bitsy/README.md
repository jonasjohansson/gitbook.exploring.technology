# Bitsy

Bitsy is a small emulator for small worlds made by [Adam Le Doux](https://twitter.com/adamledoux). However, this simplicity is incredibly useful for making focused and deliberate ideas. It gives every choice a lot of weight. Because it is so simple, it is also a great tool for prototyping ideas, or getting something down on paper right away. 

### Install

Bitsy \([link](http://ledoux.io/bitsy/editor.html)\) runs in the browser and requires no installations
