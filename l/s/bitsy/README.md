# Bitsy

Bitsy is a small emulator for small worlds made by [Adam Le Doux](https://twitter.com/adamledoux). However, this simplicity is incredibly useful for making focused and deliberate ideas. It gives every choice a lot of weight.

### Install

Bitsy \([link](http://ledoux.io/bitsy/editor.html)\) runs in the browser and requires no installations.

### Tools

There are several other game design tools that can be of interest, such as [Twine](https://twinery.org/) and [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)… and [Phaser](https://phaser.io/), [Gdevelop](https://gdevelop-app.com/), [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/), [Babylon](https://www.babylonjs.com/games/) and [RPG Maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPG_Maker).
