Every row corresponds to a different _voice._ The __grey one is used for percussive sounds, while red, yellow and blue can be set to whatever instrument.    
Each number corresponds to a different pattern, that can be edited in the piano roll section. Each voice can have ten different patterns.

In _song settings_ you can change the tempo \(BPM\) or the sequencer. Press space bar to play/stop. The scale normal + happy face corresponds to a major scale, while normal + sad face to a minor scale. Selecting a scale, you will be allowed to use only notes that belogs to that scale \(harmony safe option\). Selecting expert you can use all notes \(weird stuff option\).
