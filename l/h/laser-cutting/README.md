# Laser Cutting

Laser cutting is a great tool for rapidly transferring digital designs into real life objects. A laser cutter is a machine with a tube that concentrates light enough to be able to cut and engrave lots of different materials such as wood, paper and acrylic. Through a series of mirrors, this beam of light is directed down onto a work surface and controlled via X + Y axis stepper motors.

While a laser cutter can function as an \(expensive\) laser printer, I strongly encourage you to think of it as more than that, to create designs that are three dimensional, interactive and able to move. It is much more interesting to design a car than to engrave a picture of a car onto a surface.
