## üéÆ Game

Work in **teams of four** and create an Arduino **mini-game** using at least **two inputs**. The game should include light and sound as ways of indicating the different outcomes. **No screens allowed**. Invent something from scratch, or create your own adaptation of something existing. Great experiences need not be complex.

## üéÆ Hack

Work in **teams** and create an Arduino **interface**, that in combination with [Mio](https://jonasjohansson.itch.io/mio) will act as the control for a game. Can you change the way a game is experienced through its controls?

For retro games, use browser based emulators such as [PlayEmulator](https://www.playemulator.com/), as well as the great desktop app [OpenEmu](https://openemu.org/). For classic and recent desktop games check out [Steam](https://steampowered.com/) \(you will need to create an account\).
