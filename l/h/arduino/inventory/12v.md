# 12V

Sensors and LEDs are low-power devices that can be powered directly from Arduino from the 5 and 3.3v pins. High-power devices such as solenoids, motors or lights require a bit more, often 12v. To control these from Arduino we use a Transistor, specifically the TIP120 Darlington Transistor.

This schematic assumes that there is **external power plugged into the Arduino**. The motor in this schematic can be replaced with a light or a fan. **Note the direction also of the diode, the white strip should be on the Power end.**
