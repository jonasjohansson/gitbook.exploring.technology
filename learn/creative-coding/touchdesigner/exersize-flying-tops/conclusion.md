# Conclusion

Congratulations on finalizing your very first TouchDesigner project! 

I hope you enjoyed getting your first steps into node based programming, see some of its potential and how it might benefit you. TouchDesigner is a huge topic with a crazy amount of things you can do. It's better to see it as an environment which ties together other pieces of software rather than just a singular thing. Many of the operators you are using encapsulate packages that run complete libraries and programming languages such as GLSL \(Shaders\), Python and C++ under the hood. If you are familiar with script based languages you can extend them within TouchDesigner as well.

### Next steps

Within TouchDesigner you can explore the Operator Snippets section under Help to see working examples of most operators. Besides that there is the Palette Browser which shows template projects for many common uses and custom build tools.

To get a feeling for what people are building take a look at the official TouchDesigner Instagram account.

The forums on the Derivative site are quite useful as well. There is also a discord server where you usually get very quick feedback if you have a question about something.

In the next section you can find a more advanced exercise, along with an example file. We're still in the process of writing an article for these.
