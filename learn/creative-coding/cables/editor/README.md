A big challenge with any new software, is to make yourself familair to the environment and get used to the flow of interaction its creators had in mind.

Hover over Create, and click Empty Project.

The cables UI consists of three large panes, the light grey section on the left, is where you will create and connect little blocks called OP's \(short for operators\).

On the top right is the preview window, this will show the visual output of your patch.

The lower right has a section on the left which will show the properties of any OP you select, and on the right you can choose what to show. The options are visible when you over over each of the icons:

* **Documentation** This will show you the relevant documentation with each selected OP.
* **Code** See the source code \(JavaScript\) of each OP, if you know JavaScript you can create or change your own OP's. Don't worry about this for now.
* **Texture Preview** This shows a thumbnail of any texture \(image\) you select in your patch.
* **Keyframes** Cables also gives access to a timeline, allowing you to change values in a similar way like After Effects. Don't worry about this for now.
* **Variables** Variables are values that you can store and use in multiple places. This is also possible by patching \(the process of connecting OP's\) but without needing lines connected to it, this can be handy in some situations.
* **Patch connection** A feature to stream your output to another browser window
* **History** Shows your recent actions, you can always undo and redo using `CMD`+`Z` and `CMD`+`SHIFT`+`Z`
