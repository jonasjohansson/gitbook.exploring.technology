# Interface

Work in **teams of two** and create an Arduino **music or game interface**. The interface should use [Mio](../expert/keyboard-midi.md#mio), and the  application of your choice.

For music, check out [Soundplant](https://soundplant.org/) and [Ableton](http://ableton.com/).

For retro games, use browser based emulators such as [PlayEmulator](https://www.playemulator.com/), as well as the great desktop app [OpenEmu](https://openemu.org/). For classic and recent desktop games check out [Steam](https://steampowered.com/) \(you will need to create an account\).
