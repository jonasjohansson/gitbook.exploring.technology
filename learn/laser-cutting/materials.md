# Materials

Laser cutters can cut and engrave in several materials. For an extensive list visit [https://fslaser.com/Applications/](https://fslaser.com/Applications/) and [https://atxhs.org/wiki/Laser\_Cutter\_Materials](https://atxhs.org/wiki/Laser_Cutter_Materials). 

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not cut any of [these materials](http://cardiffhackspace.co.uk/knowledge-base/laser-cutter-dangerous-materials/) and do not use anything that is made of, or may contain, **vinyl.** Do not use **fake leather**, unless it's known to be ​non-chlorinated​ PU \(PolyUrethane\).

### Cardboard

Free, easily available everywhere, light. Always make tests out of this before cutting real material you paid money for!

### [Plywood](https://www.bauhaus.se/furuplywood-4mm-1220x2440mm)

A great affordable material that looks nice and cuts really well. It is easy to make solid structures from very thin plywood.

### MDF

Think of this as nice cardboard. It is very cheap and easy to laser, but not the most attractive material in its raw colour. It is basically heavily packed and glued fibres which make is very sturdy, but also more slightly tougher to laser than plywood. It's great for kerf bending and living hinges.

### Acrylic

By far the most expensive material, but the nicest to cut. It usually comes with protective stickers on both sides, making it the cleanest once cut. It is possible to glue together, but requires special glue, and press fit acrylic parts have a tendency to break if they are too tight. It comes in all kinds of fun colours, including mirrored versions.

🌱Be mindful of the environment when choosing materials and planning your cuts. Some materials such as \(a lot of types of\) acrylic are very difficult to recycle, others are actually recycled materials themselves. When submitting your project for cutting, we ask you to first make a version cut out of cardboard to test your design. Also try to be as efficient as possible with your cutting surface to reduce waste.

### Buyers guide

Finding materials is not trivial as most distributors does not provide wood nor plastic sheets in small sizes and low quantities. Make sure to verify with the distributor beforehand that they can provide according to your needs.
