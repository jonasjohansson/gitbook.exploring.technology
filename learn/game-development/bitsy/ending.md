# 5. Ending

If the game should have an ending, it must be made. Again, select **exits & endings** and hit **+ending**. These work exactly like exits, except that they have dialog, and end the game. You can have multiple endings in your game! The game will start over once the ending is reached.

Now that you know what your game is, be sure to give it a title. Thatâ€™s the text box at the very top of the screen. **Play through and admire your work.**
