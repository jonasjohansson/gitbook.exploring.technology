# Laser Cutting

Laser cutting is a great tool for rapidly transferring digital designs into real life objects. It is just one method of doing this, with other ones being CNC and 3D printing. All of these methods have their strengths and weaknesses, but this course is focusing on laser cutting because it is by far the simplest to understand as well as the fastest.

A laser cutter is a machine with a tube \(either diodes which are tiny, or C02 which is much much bigger\) that concentrates light enough to be able to cut and engrave lots of different materials such as wood, paper and acrylic. Through a series of mirrors, this beam of light is directed down onto a work surface and controlled via X + Y axis stepper motors. 

Since laser cutting is a computer controlled system, this allows us to make very very precise cuts, usually within 0.01mm, something that would be impossible with traditional woodworking or handcraft. This precision allows for parts to press fit together and stay without glue or to create intricate engraving designs.

While a laser cutter can function as an \(expensive\) laser printer, I strongly encourage you to think of it as more than that, to create designs that are three dimensional, interactive and able to move. It is much more interesting to design a car than to engrave a picture of a car onto a surface.

Laser cutting and design is not as complicated as you assume. It is possible to quickly learn the basics and adapt the machine to your project needs. Experimentation is strongly encouraged, within safe parameters, of course!
