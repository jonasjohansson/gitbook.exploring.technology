# Input

Makey Makey uses resistive touch which in our case mean voltage is HIGH when the trigger pads are touched, and LOW in combination with touching Earth. When this happens the system  understands this as a "touch".

We extend the trigger pads by using the alligator clips, which in turn can be connected to anything conductive to create a custom circuit or "button".

#### Conductive Materials

* People! Connect one person to ground, and another to an input, and you can trigger sounds when they high-five.
* Fruits, vegetables and foods made out of or containing gelatine.
* Plants \(can't be too dry\)
* Play-Doh and other clays \(trolldeg\) as long as they stay moist
* Graphite from a pencil can work. Make thick, dark lines, and be sure to draw on a smooth surface.
* Foil and other metal objects will work. Try out coins, magnets, nuts and bolts, forks and knives, or pots and pans.
* Copper tape \(remember to check whether the adhesive is conductive or not\)
* _Bare conductive paint_ is a speciality conductive paint made for use with electronics projects.
* _Pencil Lead and Artist Pencils,_ particularly pencils 6B or higher_,_ are a great way to sketch circuits. All pencil lead is conductive, however, the higher the Lead number the more graphite will be produced on your drawing.
* _Brass paper fasteners_ are one of our favourite conductors often found locked away gathering dust in a supply closet. This old school office supply can be found at most office supply stores or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/ACCO-Brass-Paper-Fasteners-Plated/dp/B004LWSFAK/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2LRH079NN3DTY&keywords=brass+fasteners&qid=1550248012&s=gateway&sprefix=brass+fas%2Caps%2C163&sr=8-3). Make sure you get fasteners that are not coated, and if they are, you can lightly sand off the clear coating to get to the conductive metal! 
* _Aluminum Foil Tape_ 
* Conductive thread

It is possible to remap the trigger pads to trigger other keys than those predefined. Check out the [Makey Makey remap guide](https://makeymakey.com/pages/remap) and get going.
