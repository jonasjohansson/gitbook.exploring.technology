# Online resources

To work with point clouds, you don't necessarily need to capture it yourself. There are a lot of amazing public resources which offer 3D meshes and point clouds. I'll list a few here to get you started.

Thingiverse offers a lot of free scans mainly intended for 3D printing.

Scan the world is a great place with lots of free classical statues.

Sketchfab can be tricky to navigate, but holds some really high quality datasets.

Other places that are always good to look, are universities, public archives and research facilities. Often they publish their point cloud data. You can also find a lot from space agencies, satellites and observatories.
