### Tips

* Always remember you can downscale the amount of points in the Common section of the Point File In parameter window.
* Make sure to store any additional information you might need in your point cloud. \(ie. Normal directions, UV map, etc.\)
* Point clouds and performance is very hardware dependent, recommended is to use Windows with a strong graphics card, ideally Nvidia GeForce 1080 or so. 
* Point clouds are a balance between many different steps, make sure to spend proper time on capturing, cleaning and prepping your model.
