# Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed getting familiar with point clouds. They're a big topic, so please see this article simply as a starting point from which you can continue your exploration. To some extend you can use TOPs to play with animating their position, as well as some excellent components build in TD by the community. Once you feel ready, the biggest step will be to move forward with GLSL in order to have direct control of what is happening with your points. We're planning on including sections on these in the near future.



### Tips

* Always remember you can downscale the amount of points in the Common section of the Point File In parameter window.
* Make sure to store any additional information you might need in your point cloud. \(ie. Normal directions, UV map, etc.\)
* Point clouds and performance is very hardware dependent, recommended is to use Windows with a strong graphics card, ideally Nvidia GeForce 1080 or so. 
* Point clouds are a balance between many different steps, make sure to spend proper time on capturing, cleaning and prepping your model.
* Once you feel confident with visualizing point clouds, start looking into ways you can influence and animate them. Drive them through noise for instance, turn them into particles, there's a whole world of options.
