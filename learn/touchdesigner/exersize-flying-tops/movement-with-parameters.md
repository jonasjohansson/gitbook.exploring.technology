# Movement with parameters

Lets get interactive. 

The plan is to have our object move along with the mouse position, we're going to make this happen using CHOPs and then connect that CHOP data to some of the parameters of the Composite OP.

Hit `TAB` to open up the operator create menu, then hit `TAB` again to move over to the CHOP section. 

Type and select the Mouse In CHOP. Place it somewhere below our TOP setup.

Move your mouse around and you will see there is already a tx and ty channel set up that changes when you move the mouse. 

Depending on your screen setup it ranges from -1 to 1 on tx, and -0.5 and 0.5 on ty. If you have TouchDesigner open on a second screen the tx value goes up all the way to 3. Below this page there is an optional step to dial that range into something we can use.
