# TouchDesigner

TouchDesigner is a "node based programming environment" \(also known as "visual coding"\) where you connect blocks \(known as operators\) creating interactivity and real-time visuals. Other software that applies visual coding are [Notch](https://www.notch.one/), [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/), [VVVV](https://vvvv.org/) and [Cables](https://cables.gl/) to name a few,

As a chameleon within the art and technology industry, TD is often used for realtime visuals, cultural events, brands and retail experiences, interactive installations and much more.
