# TouchDesigner

TouchDesigner is a "node based programming environment" aka "visual coding" where you connect blocks \(known as operators\) creating interactivity and real-time visuals. Other software that applies visual coding are [Notch](https://www.notch.one/), [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/), [VVVV](https://vvvv.org/) and [Cables](https://cables.gl/) to name a few.

As a chameleon within the art and technology industry, TD is often used for realtime visuals, cultural events, brands and retail experiences, interactive installations and much more.

TouchDesigner works on Mac and Windows. Keep in mind that on Mac there are a few restrictions related to the graphics card.
