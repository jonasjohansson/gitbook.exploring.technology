# Operators

Operators can be seen as tiny programs that can be chained together to build all sorts of things. There are a lot of them, and they come in various types. Most operators have inputs and outputs, expecting data to arrive on the left \(input\), and then present data on the right \(output\), ready to be retrieved.

Press `TAB` to open the list of operators \(OP Create Dialog\), or right-click and **Add operator**. The types of operators are seen in the top, hover their label to see a description at the bottom of the window. Press `TAB` again to cycle between the different operators.

The four most commonly used operators are the TOP, CHOP, SOP and DAT.

### TOP

Texture operators are **purple**, the fastest and most powerful component in TD, and handle anything related to pixel data; composing image streams, blurring, detecting edges or handling external devices like depth cameras to point clouds.

### CHOP

Channel operators are **green** and are mostly made to do math and logic operations. This way you can program behaviour which can in turn be placed onto parameters of other operators to automatically control them.

### SOP

Surface operators are **blue** and relate to shapes in 3D space.

### DAT

Data operators are **violet-red** and can be used to handle data, text and scripting. DATs often go hand in hand with Python!
