# Augmented Reality

AR in the browser is developing fast, thanks to efforts by the [AR.js](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/) team initiated by [Nicol√≤ Carpignioli](https://twitter.com/nicolocarp). 

 The augmented reality super powers are made possible by including [AR.js](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/) in the `<head>`. There are currently three tracking methods available:

{% page-ref page="marker.md" %}

{% page-ref page="location.md" %}

{% page-ref page="image.md" %}
