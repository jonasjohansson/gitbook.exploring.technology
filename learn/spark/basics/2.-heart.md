# 2. Heart

Click **Library** and select **3D Shapes**. Scroll down and click the Heart Primitive and select **Import Free**. The window does not automatically close, so close the windowâ€¦

Finally, **Assets** is not empty anymore. Grab the Heart, and drag it into the **Viewport** \(the large grey space in the middle\). It should appear under **Scene** and become visible.
