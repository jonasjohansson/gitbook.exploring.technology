# 3. Test on device

Let's make sure the heart is also visible on your mobile device. 

### Preview

Click **Test on device** and under **Preview on Spark Player** there should be the connected device and a **Send** button. If not, make sure to open the Spark AR Player app on the connected device.

Once ready, click **Send**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Every time the Spark AR Studio app is updated, the mobile app must also be updated.
{% endhint %}

On success, there should be a heart dead center of the screen. Let's stick around in the mobile app for a while.

There are four options in the bottom:

* Presentation mode \(resizing arrow\)
* Capture/Record
* Flip camera
* Photos

In the top left you can view all the effects previously uploaded, stored by name and time. We didn't name our project, so it's called Untitled. This name is also visible at the bottom left, along with a timestamp.

{% hint style="success" %}
Always name your project, and duplicate it along with a version number. This will help you when you debug.
{% endhint %}

### Send to App

When you want someone else to try out the effect, or when you don't have access to a USB cable, click **Send** next to **Instagram Camera**.

After a moment there should be a notification stating that the effect has been added, and a test link has appeared. This link can be shared with up to 200 views.

Whenever there has been a change in the project, click **Refresh** to update the link.

{% hint style="info" %}
A notification will also appear on the connected Instagram account.
{% endhint %}
