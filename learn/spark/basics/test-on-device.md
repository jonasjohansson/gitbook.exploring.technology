# 3. Test on device

Let's make sure the heart is also visible on your mobile device. Click **Test on device** and under **Preview on Spark Player** there should be the connected device and a **Send** button. If not, make sure to open the Spark AR Player app on the connected device.

Once ready, click **Send**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Every time the Spark AR Studio app is updated, the mobile app must also be updated.
{% endhint %}

If successful, there should be a heart dead center of the screen. Let's stick around in the mobile app for a while.

There are four options in the bottom:

* Presentation mode \(resizing arrow\)
* Capture/Record
* Flip camera
* Photos

In the top left you can view all the effects previously uploaded, stored by name and time. We didn't name our project, so it's called Untitled. This name is also visible at the bottom left, along with a timestamp.

{% hint style="success" %}
Always name your project, and duplicate it along with a version number. This will help you when you debug.
{% endhint %}

Let's return to the desktop app.
