# Target Tracking

Perhaps the most interesting feature are the target and plane tracking abilities. For some reason, most of the AR community is fascinated with playing around with the face.

## Getting started

Create a **New Project** and choose **Target Tracking**. A template should open with some preset assets, we'll get to those in a minute.

The editor is easy to understand. There's the **Scene** in the top left, and the **Assets** in the bottom left. 

{% hint style="success" %}
When using a new software, pause a bit, and look around. 
{% endhint %}

In the far left there's a menu that reads:

1. Workspace
2. Camera
3. Play
