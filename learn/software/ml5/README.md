# Machine Learning

## [**ml5js**](https://ml5js.org/)

A framework which aims to make machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students. The library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building on top of [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) with no other external dependencies. ****

## FeatureExtractor

You can use neural networks to recognise the content of images. Most of the time you will be using a "pre-trained" model trained on a large dataset to classify an image into a fixed set of categories. However you can also use a part of the pre-trained model: the [features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction). Those features allow you to 'retrain' or 'reuse' the model for a new custom task. This is known as [Transfer Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning).
