# Sound

Playing sound is simple and fun, and can easily be used together with the statements and variables from before. [Let’s look at the example provided by P5.js](https://p5js.org/examples/sound-load-and-play-sound.html).

There’s a lot you can do with sound in P5.js, like building your own instrument!

[Check out the reference guide and see what’s possible.](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound)
