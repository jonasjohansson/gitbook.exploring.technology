# Machine Learning \(ml5\)

Artificial intelligence, a disputed term since it presents two vague and probably incorrect words in combination. A large umbrella under which machine learning breathes bits and bytes. ML5 is a framework which aims to make machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students. The library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building on top of [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) with no other external dependencies. ****

### Install

ML5 \([link](https://ml5js.org/)\) runs in the browser and requires no installation. It works well in P5 \([link](https://editor.p5js.org/)\) with several examples available. Get started by reading the [learn section](https://learn.ml5js.org/docs/#/), and play with some machines!
