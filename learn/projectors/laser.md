# Laser

Laser projectors are fantastic and produce a light that is impossible to match with projection. In order to control a laser projector you \(often\) require a Digital-to-Analog Converter \(DAC\) such as the [Ether Dream](https://ether-dream.com/) or [Helios](https://bitlasers.com/helios-laser-dac/). There are also several laser projectors available with [Kvant](https://www.kvantlasers.sk/collections/) being a very recognised brand, available for hire and purchase by [Laserboy](http://www.laserboy.se/) \(Stockholm\).
