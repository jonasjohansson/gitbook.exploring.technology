### Adding Color

To change the color and texture of 3d objects you can use materials.

[Basicmaterial](https://cables.gl/op/Ops.Gl.Shader.BasicMaterial_v3) is the most basic one.

### Using Images As Texture

_Tip: To upload an image to cables, you can either upload it via the upload-button of an op which has a file-input or drag’n’drop an image onto the cables window_

* Create an `Ops.Gl.Texture`-op and connect it to your material \(to the first purple texture port\)
* The new texture op has a `file` input. Click the file icon next to it and select the uploaded image.
