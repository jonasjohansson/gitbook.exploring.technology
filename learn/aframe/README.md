[A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) is a web framework built on [Three.js](https://threejs.org) for building mixed reality experiences. It is made possible thanks to WebGL \(Web Graphics Library\), a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser. WebGL elements can be mixed with other HTML elements and composited with other parts of the page or page background.
