[A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) is a web framework built on [Three.js](https://threejs.org) for building mixed reality experiences. It is made possible thanks to the Web Graphics Library \(WebGL\).

### Install

A-Frame runs in the browser and is included as a JavaScript library in an HTML document. Use an online editor such as [Glitch](../../tips-trix/glitch.md) \(choose New Project and Hello Webpage\) or create an index.html file locally using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
