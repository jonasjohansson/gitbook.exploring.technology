# Particles

Ever heard the concept of particles in CGI? It's an amazing thing that allows us to create the illusion of rain, snow, fire, dust and much more. In A-Frame you can easily get started by including the [A-Frame Particle System](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-particle-system-component) script!

```markup
<script src="https://unpkg.com/aframe-particle-system-component@1.0.x/dist/aframe-particle-system-component.min.js"></script> 
```

And then add the attribute _particle-system_ along with some parameters and off you go!

```markup
<a-entity particle-system="color: #EF0000,#44CC00"></a-entity>
```
