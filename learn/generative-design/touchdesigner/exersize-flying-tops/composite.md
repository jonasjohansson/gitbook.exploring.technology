# Composite

### Composite

To bring our two operators together we can use a Composite OP. This is an extremely powerful operator that you'll use on a regular basis. Think of it a bit as the Layer composite options in Photoshop, but in real-time!

Set the Operation to Add, and move over to the Transform section. 

For our triangle to show up correctly, we'll have to set the Fixed Layer to Input 1, and Pre-fit Overlay to Native Resolution. Your triangle should now show up as a small object in the middle.
