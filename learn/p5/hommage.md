# Hommage

Work in **teams of three** and create **individual generative artworks** inspired by an **existing artwork** or **artist technique**.

The pieces should be saved as an image, or video if animated, and uploaded to a shared Instagram. If there are more media files included, feel free to include these.

Each piece should be uploaded **as its own post**, and have text mentioning the source of inspiration together with a link to to the project. Feel free to add any additional information such as your name, website and Instagram handle.  If any of these steps are missed, it is possible to include as a comment.

The purpose of this is for viewers to see the work on their own devices, view the code if curious,  understand where the inspiration came from and get in touch.
