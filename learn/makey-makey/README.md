Makey Makey is an electronic invention tool that allows users to connect everyday objects to computer programs. Using a circuit board, alligator clips, and a USB cable, the Makey Makey uses closed loop electrical signals to send the computer either a keyboard stroke or mouse click signal. This function allows it to work with any computer program or webpage that accepts keyboard or mouse click inputs. It is designed similar to the early Nintendo controllers and comes with a D-pad \(Up, Down, Left, Right\) and two main buttons \(Space, Click\), all of which can be reprogrammed to trigger other keys.

 You may see a popup window asking you to identify a keyboard, ignore and close it.

Attach one end of the alligator clips to **Earth** and hold the other end **between your fingers**.

With **your other hand**, touch the **Space** button. If everything works, your touch should be the same as if you pressed the spacebar on your computer. Try out a [banana piano](https://apps.makeymakey.com/piano/) or play some [bongos](https://apps.makeymakey.com/bongos/)!
