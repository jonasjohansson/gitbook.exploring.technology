## 3D-2D using Slicer

This is an amazing tool for rapidly creating laser plans from 3D files. It takes a .stl file or similar and converts it into flat shapes which you can cut and assemble. If you are looking for something more complicated than a box, this is a great starting point.

## Stacking

Since the laser is lower powered, you may want to stack slices to make thicker objects. Using registration holes and dowel pins, you can cut shapes and align them perfectly. This is useful when you want to make a 2.5D object

## Chains

## Living Hinges

This is a way to draw a pattern in such a way to be able to fold wood. It is kind of magic and gets used a lot in laser projects, but it still can be useful in cases where you want to make curves out of one piece of material. Some materials do this really well \(MDF\) and some do not \(acrylic\).
