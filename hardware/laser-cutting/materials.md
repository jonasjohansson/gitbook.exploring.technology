# Materials

Laser cutters can cut and engrave in several materials, below is a list of some of the most common. For an extensive list visit [https://fslaser.com/Applications/](https://fslaser.com/Applications/) and [https://atxhs.org/wiki/Laser\_Cutter\_Materials](https://atxhs.org/wiki/Laser_Cutter_Materials).

The most common materials you are going to use are cardboard, plywood, MDF and acrylic. They each have their strengths and weaknesses.

### Cardboard

Free, easily available everywhere, lightweight. Make tests out of this before cutting real material you paid money for.

### Plywood

A great pretty cheap material that looks nice and cuts really well. It is easy to make solid structures from very thin plywood. My favorite kind is 3mm birch, for its beauty and solidness. Solid wood is also an option to laser, and it cuts much easier than plywood, but harder to find in thin pieces and much more fragile. Also engraving on solid wood is a bit weird since its density is uneven.

### MDF

Think of this as nice cardboard. It is very cheap and easy to laser, but not the most attractive material. It is the most flexible, making it great for kerf bending and living hinges.

### Acrylic

By far the most expensive material, but the nicest to cut. It usually comes with protective stickers on both sides, making it the cleanest once cut. It is possible to glue together, but requires special glue, and press fit acrylic parts have a tendency to break if they are too tight. It comes in all kinds of fun colors, including mirrored versions.

{% hint style="success" %}
Be mindful of the environment when choosing materials and planning your cuts. Some materials such as acrylic are very difficult to recycle, others are actually recycled materials themselves. When submitting your project for cutting, we ask you to first make a version cut out of cardboard to test your design.

Don't use anything that is made of, or may contain, **vinyl**. When lasered, a gas will be created which **will ruin the laser cutter** and **your health**. Do not use **fake leather**, unless it's known to be ‚Äãnon-chlorinated‚Äã PU \(PolyUrethane\).

## Distributors

Finding materials is not trivial as most distributors does not provide wood nor plastic sheets in small sizes and low quantities. Make sure to verify with the distributor beforehand that they can provide according to your needs.
