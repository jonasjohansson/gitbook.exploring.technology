### Generative Design

Through [P5](https://p5js.org/) participants scratch the surface of artificial intelligence as they learn about generative design, and how machines can help make art, music and experiences!

### Generative Audio

Learn the ropes integrating sound and music into your projects, using pre-made clips or the builtin WebAudio API.

### A-Frame AR/VR

Browser based world building and mixed reality. With A-Frame and [Glitch]() participants learn the basics of web powered graphics development while hacking their environment using virtual and augmented reality.

## Bonus

These are workshops that can be held if there is interest. They could also be completely different topics based on suggestions, but this is a range of web powered tools that can really open up some doors.

### ✨ Electron

Use Node.js and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and create multi-platform desktop apps! Check out the [list of apps](https://www.electronjs.org/apps) made in Electron \(for instance Slack\).

→ [Create an account on Itch](https://itch.io/)

### ✨ Internet of Things

Interact with reality by building your own data driven project, using an [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) device to a public Internet hotspot! Teams interested in using this may receive a package with all required components for a first project.

### ✨ Machine Learning

Teach a machine using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and integrate it using [ml5.js](https://ml5js.github.io/) and p5.js. This workshop will demonstrate how to use Audio, Video and Pose data to create web interactions.!
