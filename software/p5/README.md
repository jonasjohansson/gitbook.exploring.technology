# Processing

For over 15 years Processing, a software written by developers for artists, have been available. Here you can easy create graphics, typography, interactive artworks, games and more. And since a few years back there's also a Javascript variant which ensures that your creation is easy to view and share.

Generative design is the symbios between machine and designer. The machine creates massive quantities while the designer uses its experience and knowledge to make qualitative choices.
