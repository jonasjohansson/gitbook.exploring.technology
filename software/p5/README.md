For over 15 years Processing, a software written by developers for artists, have been available. Here you can easy create graphics, typography, interactive artworks, games and more. And since a few years back there's also a Javascript variant which ensures that your creation is easy to view and share.

Generative design and art is the symbiosis between machine and designer. The machine creates massive quantities while the designer uses its experience and knowledge to make qualitative choices.

## Generative design

To begin to understand the field of generative and procedural design, let's begin by looking at relevant art through history. Modern art is broad term, but the consensus of its beginnings is focused on a disruption in representing historical and/or mythological figures, towards the representation of everyday life themes and subjects.

> Abstract art is art that does not attempt to represent an accurate depiction of a visual reality but instead use shapes, colours, forms and gestural marks to achieve its effect.

In rejecting history and the realistic depiction of subjects, artists also embraced experimentation with form. The freedom in shapes, colours and lines was the fertile ground for abstract art to flourish.

> Although many different styles are encompassed by the term, there are certain underlying principles that define modernist art: A rejection of history and conservative values \(such as realistic depiction of subjects\); innovation and experimentation with form \(the shapes, colours and lines that make up the work\) with a tendency to abstraction; and an emphasis on materials, techniques and processes.

Itâ€™s commonly accepted that Kandinsky was the pioneer of abstract art, however the abstract works of Hilma af Klint \(Stockholm 1862-1944\) predate Kandinsky, Malevich and Mondrian for several years.  The revelation of Hilma's works was delayed also due to her expressed wishes in will that her works should not shown to the world for 20 years after her death!

A close look to the early abstract works reveals a deliberate use of repetition in form, and sets of rules to help guide the progression of the piece. Thinking in those terms will be the foundation of algorithmic-based art, or generative design. We'll continue by looking how this manifests itself through the aid of machines, and in various kinds of media.

## Music

In the arts, it refers to art which is generated by an autonomous system. Such systems are typically computer algorithms, but not necessarily. 

Steve Reichs Piano Phase is a minimalist composition, written in 1967 for two pianos \(or piano and tape\). It is one of his first attempts at applying his "phasing" technique, which he had previously used in the tape pieces It's Gonna Rain \(1965\) and Come Out \(1966\), to live performance.

Generative design is a broad term. It refers to autonomous systems which  enhance or replace human-based design in e.g. manufacturing, music and visual arts.
