# Save & Export

To export your game so other people can play it, go to the **download** window in the tools. This will export your game as an HTML file. You can upload this to a website or just click on it on the desktop to have in launch in a browser.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can also load a Bitsy game from a previously exported HTML file!
{% endhint %}

If you want to keep working on your game, you will need to save the game data. this is the text data that represents logic, pixel art, and text of your game. In the game data window, you can chose to download it or just copy it into a text file.

Because bitsy saves this information to the browser, you probably don’t have to save if you’re using the same computer \(like your laptop\). You can close the window and come back. That said, it is a good idea just in case- and if you are using a shared computer always download this data. 

{% hint style="danger" %}
Your game is saved within the browser. If you clear your browser cache, the game is lost. Always download the game data to be sure progress is maintained.
