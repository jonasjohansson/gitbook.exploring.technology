# Paint & Colors

The paint window is your drawing canvas. Click anywhere in the avatar grid and a block will either appear or disappear. 

If you expand the **animation** option at the bottom of the window, you can add a second frame. The other tabs in the paint window behave equally. Notice that the pixels from the previous frame have their opacity reduced.

Picking the right colors help set the mood and ambiance! Color is defined for **background**, **tile** and **sprite**. 

Toggle the **Palette select** to create multiple palettes, which can later be connected to specific rooms.  The default colors are: **\#0052cc** \(background\), **\#809fff** \(tile\) and  **\#ffffff** \(sprite\).
