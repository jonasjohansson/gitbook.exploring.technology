# Preparing content

Video content for remixing can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/). To get a hold of the actual video file use [Clipgrab](https://clipgrab.org/) or [Keepvid](http://keepvid.com/). Choose the highest resolution when downloading, and pay respect to copyright restrictions.

### Seamless loop

A clip where the start and end frame connect is a seamless loop. These can endlessly play without causing visual distraction, optimal for content running in the background.

### Partitioning

Attempt to divide a clip into multiple smaller ones, this allows for a flexible set where the performer can efficiently create compositions that does not feel repetitive.

1. Open Quicktime Player
2. File &gt; Open File &gt; Select video clip
3. Edit &gt; Trim
4. Drag to select start and end frame
5. Trim and save!

Consider the length and the pacing of the clip, there is no definite rule but between 5 to 20 seconds is normally good. It's great to try and structure ones material based on pacing as we strive for dynamic compositions that enhance the music and keep the energy going.

### Optimisation

Choosing how to encode your content is critical in audio-visual performance. The codec that you choose will affect how much processor time is used to decompress each video frame. This in turn will determine how many layers of smoothly playing video you can use and how many audio effects you can apply.

For the very best performance in Resolume you should use the Resolume DXV codec. It is by far the fastest codec because Resolume can decompress the video frames on the GPU instead of the CPU.

Resolume comes installed with its own codec named [DXV](https://resolume.com/software/codec). For the actual encoding use [Mpeg Streamclip](http://www.squared5.com/) and follow [this guide](http://resolume.com/manual/en/r5/dxv#mpeg_streamclip).

**NOTE:** The final file size can increase tenfold.
