# Machine learning

## [**ml5js**](https://ml5js.org/)

A framework which aims to make machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students. The library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building on top of [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) with no other external dependencies. ****
