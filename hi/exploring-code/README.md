# Exploring Code

A multi-faceted project of play, narrative and technology is what the students at Hyper Island will experience as they press start. The four-week project Exploring Technology will encourage the creation of transformative experiences and offer a plethora of workshops, ranging from laser cutting to machine learning, allowing the teams to strategically gain the knowledge they require.

In order to further facilitate learning and reflection, a mid delivery in the shape of a three-day sprint project will train students in the art of making choices and delivering a solid experience and presentation. All training wheels are then removed as the teams work towards the final project, an exhibition encouraging participation, imagination, activation and transformation.
