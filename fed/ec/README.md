# Exploring Code

_Exploring Code: The students will get to create outside the norm and challenge the way interfaces are built. Art, music, virtual reality experiences - the possibilities are endless. Hands-on creation, testing the limits and insights of the creative process. — Hyper Island curriculum_

### A Brief History

For 30 years HTML have been around, providing basic building blocks for complex experiences in the browser. 5 years after JavaScript and CSS came along, improving both functionality and aesthetics. Since then, this triad can be found anywhere there is a browser. _Let's give PHP and MySQL some credit here as well for its success._

Along with an increase in web sites followed an explosion of users, and suddenly we begin studying user interface design at an increasing scale \([Designing Web Usability](https://www.nngroup.com/books/designing-web-usability/) and [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/) anyone?\). 

We began seeing responsive CSS styles, terms like [graceful degradation and progressive enhancement](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement). We swore at Internet Explorer and had to write things like:

```markup
<!--[if !IE]> -->
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheets/no-ie.css">
<!-- <![endif]-->
```

1999 and onwards we realised that instead of building web sites we could create **web systems** and the blog was born with Wordpress \(2003\) moving from personal platform to the number one CMS for companies. _And along came e-commerce and Facebook…_

2007 the smartphone became a thing, and suddenly we had to consider touch and all the other inputs that a smartphone had \(sound, video, light, GPS, motion\). This made the browser **become personal**. Soon Flash died and instead made space for AJAX, and [JQuery](https://jquery.org/) and other libraries assisting in the building of engaging interfaces.

2009 we saw [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) make an entrance allowing JavaScript to communicate with the operative system and connected devices \(hello Bluetooth Low Energy\). Soon, everything became connected, and Internet of \([Enchanted](http://enchantedobjects.com/)\) Things got cheer leader level popular. 

2013 [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) were released, as a response to keeping web technologies relevant and more useful than ever as native applications for both mobile and desktop could be made with only one framework. A few years prior, [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) \(now [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)\) was already around, enabling beautiful  and interactive experiences in the browser.

As code bases grew, sanity had to be kept. We began working with GIT, CSS pre-compilers \([SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)\), task runners and module bundlers \(think [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)\). We built [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/) and later [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and "vanilla JavaScript" become a search term.

2015 and onward we being working with push states and service workers, making web sites feel native \(no reload\). This is something we are still looking at today with the surge of Progressive Web Applications \(PWA\), which has led to todays interest in [SVELTE](https://svelte.dev/) and [FLUTTER](https://flutter.dev/).

In the past five years

More happened of course:

1. Chat bots arrived and **artificial intelligence** found a new home \(and more recently **machine learning**\). 
2. Game driven technologies such as virtual and augmented become web powered, much thanks to [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) \(built on Three.js\).
3. And we are now back at the beginning. Building vanilla sites using Static Site Generators such as [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).



### Creativity Online

If web development once was a box of wonders, it has scaled into a universe. If you are just getting started, it can be overwhelming. But what's great is, it's all still using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And on that front, not much has fundamentally changed 



A multi-faceted project of play, narrative and technology is what the students at Hyper Island will experience as they press start. The four-week project Exploring Technology will encourage the creation of transformative experiences and offer a plethora of workshops, ranging from laser cutting to machine learning, allowing the teams to strategically gain the knowledge they require.

In order to further facilitate learning and reflection, a mid delivery in the shape of a three-day sprint project will train students in the art of making choices and delivering a solid experience and presentation. All training wheels are then removed as the teams work towards the final project, an exhibition encouraging participation, imagination, activation and transformation.
