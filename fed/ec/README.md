# Exploring Code

> The students will get to create outside the norm and challenge the way interfaces are built. Art, music, virtual reality experiences - the possibilities are endless. Hands-on creation, testing the limits and insights of the creative process.

Technology is the new religion. We build algorithms that enslave us and interfaces that offer no obstacle, no moment of learning just feeding us gratification. We don't _surf the web_ anymore, instead we scroll through services that show us other people doing things. 

Success! We have made the Internet a very pleasant place to be. _Utopia_**.** But has technology brought us closer? Does an email cost less than a letter? How can "Dark Mode" be seen as innovation?

We can do better. **This is our environment**. And in this environment we are not just the inhabitants, we are also the architects, the entrepreneurs, the builders, the change makers.

During four weeks students at Hyper Island will explore web technologies bridging the gap between screen, human and the world around.
